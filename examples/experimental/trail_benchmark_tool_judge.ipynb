    "Agent Architecture and Trace Structure: The agent architecture consists of a primary manager Agent (also referred to as CodeAgent) that delegates tasks to a search_agent (also referred to as ToolCallingAgent).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Flow:\n",
    "Every trace consists of several spans (with span_id numbers and parent span_id numbers). Each trace begins with the manager (CodeAgent). The process follows a clear, hierarchical structure where the manager outlines a high-level plan and the search_agent executes the detailed, tool-based steps for each part of that plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Manager Agent Initiation:\n",
    "The trace starts with the manager. In its initial child spans, you will observe the following sequence:\n",
    "- A preparatory survey is created based on the user's query.\n",
    "- A high-level plan is formulated from this survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Manager agent begins executing Step 1 of its plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Manager Agent Step 1:\n",
    "Within the child span for Step 1, the Manager agent decides how to proceed given the initial fact survey and plan. The Manager agent will produce a thought, which may call the search_agent to perform the necessary actions or research.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. search_agent (ToolCallingAgent) Execution Loop:\n",
    "Once called, the search_agent begins its own execution loop. In its child spans, you will observe the following sequence:\n",
    "- A preparatory survey to the specific sub-task it received from the Manager agent.\n",
    "- A plan tailored to the specific sub-task it received from the Manager agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search_agent executes an initial set of up to four steps. Each step involves an LLM call to generate a tool-call, followed by the tool's execution.\n",
    "After these initial steps, search_agent synthesizes the information gathered into an updated fact list and refines its plan.\n",
    "The search_agent may then continue to execute more tool-steps based on this updated plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop continues until the search_agent has gathered enough information to comprehensively answer the manager's sub-task, at which point it calls final_answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Returning Control to the Manager agent\n",
    "The final_answer from the search_agent is returned to the Manager agent, concluding the Manager agent's Step 1. The Manager agent then proceeds to Step 2 of its high-level plan, using the result from the previous step as context. \n",
    "This entire cycle repeats for all subsequent steps in the Manager Agent's plan.\n",

However, the plan has a critical flaw in that it does not explicitly reference or incorporate the available tools, particularly the search_agent which would be essential for executing the web research steps outlined. While the conceptual approach is sound, the plan lacks the practical tool integration necessary for feasible execution. The Manager Agent's subsequent failure to use appropriate tools during execution further highlights this planning deficiency, though this evaluation focuses solely on the plan's intrinsic quality rather than execution adherence.\\n\\nScore: 1\", 'Tool Calling_score': 0.0, 'Tool Calling_reasons': 'Criteria: Score the quality of TOOL CALLS within the agent\\'s control. 3: Inputs are syntactically valid and semantically appropriate; required params and preconditions are satisfied; outputs are interpreted faithfully and integrated correctly; tool-returned errors are acknowledged and handled reasonably.

The task explicitly stated that verification steps were needed and that the answer exists and can be found with available tools. The agent had access to a search_agent tool and created a detailed plan requiring web research to find Connected Papers documentation and DeepFruits paper details, but completely bypassed this plan. Instead, the agent made unfounded assumptions about citation counts being the determining factor without any factual basis. This represents a fundamental failure to use available tools appropriately - the agent fabricated an answer rather than using the tools designed to find the correct information. The final_answer tool was called with content that was not derived from any tool outputs, violating the principle of grounded tool use.\\n\\nScore: 0'}, {'filename': '/Users/dhuang/Documents/GAIA/fb3333ca30eb8af56d4f31839ca9e317', 'Tool Selection_score': 0.0, 'Tool Selection_reasons': \"Criteria: Score the quality of tool selection by evaluating whether agents chose the most appropriate tools for their stated tasks/subtasks, given the tool descriptions and available options.

The agent's system instructions emphasize using available tools appropriately, and the task explicitly required finding specific information from online sources.

    "Agent Architecture and Trace Structure: The agent architecture consists of a CodeAgent that has access to a sandboxed environment, a python interpreter, and the \"gitingest\" library that can turn any Git reposistory into a text digest of its codebaes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Flow:\n",
    "Every trace consists of several spans (with span_id numbers and parent span_id numbers). Each trace begins with the CodeAgent which performs actions through a cycle of steps, with existing variables and knowledge being incorporated into the agent’s context. Specifically, the CodeAgent will plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, the CodeAgent should first explain its reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that it wants to use. Then in the 'Code:' sequence, it should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence. During each intermediate step, the CodeAgent can use 'print()' to save whatever important information it will then need. These print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\n",
    "Each tool call and tool response will also be shown in each step. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the CodeAgent will have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n",
