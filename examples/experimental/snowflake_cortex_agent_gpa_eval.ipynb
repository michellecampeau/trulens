Here are the main approaches:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Method 1: Clone first, then add clustering keys**\\\\\\\\n1. Create a clone of the existing table:\\\\\\\\n   ```sql\\\\\\\\n   CREATE TABLE new_table CLONE existing_table;\\\\\\\\n   ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2. Add clustering keys to the cloned table:\\\\\\\\n   ```sql\\\\\\\\n   ALTER TABLE new_table CLUSTER BY (column1, column2);\\\\\\\\n   ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Method 2: Create clone with clustering keys in one step**\\\\\\\\nYou can also create a new table with clustering keys using CREATE TABLE AS SELECT:\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nCREATE TABLE new_table \\\\\\\\nCLUSTER BY (column1, column2) \\\\\\\\nAS SELECT * FROM existing_table;\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Key considerations:**\\\\\\\\n- Cloning preserves the data and structure but not necessarily the clustering keys from the original table\\\\\\\\n- You can add clustering keys to any table after creation using ALTER TABLE\\\\\\\\n- Clustering keys help optimize query performance by physically organizing data\\\\\\\\n- You can specify up to 4 columns as clustering keys\\\\\\\\n- The clustering process happens automatically in the background after you define the keys\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Benefits of adding clustering keys:**\\\\\\\\n- Improved query performance for filtered queries\\\\\\\\n- Better data pruning during query execution\\\\\\\\n- Reduced scan times for large tables\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe clone operation is very fast since it uses Snowflake\\'s zero-copy cloning feature, and adding clustering keys afterward will help optimize the table for your specific query patterns.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\",\\\\\"User: is if i have a transactiondate as type string sohuld i make it a date?\\\\\",\\\\\"Assistant: \\\\\\\\nYes, you should definitely convert a transaction date from string to date type. Here\\'s why:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Benefits of using DATE data type:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Performance advantages:**\\\\\\\\n- Date operations are much faster than string operations\\\\\\\\n- Better query optimization and indexing\\\\\\\\n- More efficient storage (dates take less space than strings)\\\\\\\\n- Improved clustering and partitioning performance\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Functionality benefits:**\\\\\\\\n- Built-in date functions (DATE_TRUNC, DATEADD, DATEDIFF, etc.)\\\\\\\\n- Proper date arithmetic and comparisons\\\\\\\\n- Time zone handling capabilities\\\\\\\\n- Automatic validation of date values\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Query improvements:**\\\\\\\\n- Range queries perform better (WHERE date BETWEEN \\'2023-01-01\\' AND \\'2023-12-31\\')\\\\\\\\n- Date formatting functions work properly\\\\\\\\n- Aggregations by time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly) are easier\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**How to convert:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\n-- Add new date column\\\\\\\\nALTER TABLE your_table ADD COLUMN transaction_date_new DATE;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- Convert string to date\\\\\\\\nUPDATE your_table \\\\\\\\nSET transaction_date_new = TRY_TO_DATE(transaction_date_string, \\'YYYY-MM-DD\\');\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- Check for conversion errors\\\\\\\\nSELECT * FROM your_table WHERE transaction_date_new IS NULL;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- Drop old column and rename new one\\\\\\\\nALTER TABLE your_table DROP COLUMN transaction_date_string;\\\\\\\\nALTER TABLE your_table RENAME COLUMN transaction_date_new TO transaction_date;\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Important considerations:**\\\\\\\\n- Use TRY_TO_DATE() to handle invalid date strings gracefully\\\\\\\\n- Verify the date format in your string data first\\\\\\\\n- Check for any NULL values after conversion\\\\\\\\n- Consider if you need DATE, TIMESTAMP, or TIMESTAMP_TZ based on your requirements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConverting to proper date types is almost always worth the effort for better performance and functionality.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\",\\\\\"User: does clustering take time? i just ran a cluster by and i am seeing very high overlap\\\\\",\\\\\"Assistant: \\\\\\\\nYes, clustering does take time, and seeing high overlap immediately after adding clustering keys is completely normal. Here\\'s what\\'s happening:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why clustering takes time:**\\\\\\\\n- Clustering is an **asynchronous background process** that Snowflake runs automatically\\\\\\\\n- It doesn\\'t happen instantly when you run `ALTER TABLE ... CLUSTER BY`\\\\\\\\n- The process reorganizes data physically based on your clustering keys\\\\\\\\n- Time depends on table size, data distribution, and system resources\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What \\\\\\\\\\\\\"high overlap\\\\\\\\\\\\\" means:**\\\\\\\\n- Overlap measures how much data in different micro-partitions shares the same clustering key values\\\\\\\\n- **High overlap = poor clustering** (data is scattered across many micro-partitions)\\\\\\\\n- **Low overlap = good clustering** (similar values are grouped together)\\\\\\\\n- Right after adding clustering keys, overlap will be high because data hasn\\'t been reorganized yet\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What to expect:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\n-- Check clustering information\\\\\\\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION(\\'your_table\\', \\'(column1, column2)\\');\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- Monitor clustering depth and overlap over time\\\\\\\\nSHOW TABLES LIKE \\'your_table\\';\\\\\\\\n-- Look at CLUSTERING_KEY and other clustering metrics\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Timeline expectations:**\\\\\\\\n- Small tables (< 1GB): Minutes to hours\\\\\\\\n- Medium tables (1-100GB): Hours to days  \\\\\\\\n- Large tables (> 100GB): Days to weeks\\\\\\\\n- Process runs during low-activity periods to minimize impact\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Best practices:**\\\\\\\\n- Be patient - let the automatic clustering process work\\\\\\\\n- Monitor progress with `SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION()`\\\\\\\\n- Don\\'t re-cluster manually unless absolutely necessary\\\\\\\\n- Choose clustering keys wisely (commonly filtered columns)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe high overlap you\\'re seeing should decrease over time as Snowflake\\'s automatic clustering service reorganizes your data in the background.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\",\\\\\"User: Quesiton for you. This table is massive 1TB. TRANSACTION_DATE has cardinatlit of 2700 unique vlaues. ACCOUNT_ID has very high cardinality of 7.4 million unique values. Does it make sense to add a clustering key on both columns or only one?\\\\\",\\\\\"Assistant: \\\\\\\\nFor a 1TB table with those cardinality characteristics, I\\'d recommend **clustering on TRANSACTION_DATE only**, not both columns. Here\\'s why:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why TRANSACTION_DATE alone is better:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Cardinality considerations:**\\\\\\\\n- 2,700 unique dates is ideal for clustering (good selectivity without being too granular)\\\\\\\\n- 7.4M unique ACCOUNT_IDs is extremely high cardinality - poor for clustering\\\\\\\\n- High cardinality clustering keys often provide minimal benefit and can hurt performance\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Query pattern benefits:**\\\\\\\\n- Most analytical queries filter by date ranges (monthly/quarterly reports, time-based analysis)\\\\\\\\n- Date-based clustering enables excellent partition pruning\\\\\\\\n- Time-series data naturally benefits from chronological organization\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why not both columns:**\\\\\\\\n- **Compound clustering keys become less effective** with high cardinality columns\\\\\\\\n- ACCOUNT_ID\\'s 7.4M values would create too much fragmentation\\\\\\\\n- The clustering maintenance overhead increases significantly\\\\\\\\n- Diminishing returns on query performance improvement\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Recommended approach:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nALTER TABLE your_table CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTION_DATE);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Alternative considerations:**\\\\\\\\n- If you frequently query specific account ranges, consider **partitioning strategies** instead\\\\\\\\n- For account-specific queries, proper indexing or materialized views might be better\\\\\\\\n- Consider if ACCOUNT_ID has any patterns (geographic, categorical) that could be clustered instead\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Expected benefits with date clustering:**\\\\\\\\n- Dramatic improvement for date range queries\\\\\\\\n- Better compression due to similar dates being stored together\\\\\\\\n- Faster aggregations by time periods\\\\\\\\n- Reduced scanning for time-based analytics\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe 1TB size makes clustering even more valuable, but stick with the low-cardinality date column for maximum effectiveness.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\",\\\\\"User: my clustering depth on my table is 96\\\\\",\\\\\"Assistant: \\\\\\\\nA clustering depth of 96 is **very high** and indicates poor clustering. Here\\'s what this means and what you should do:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What clustering depth means:**\\\\\\\\n- Clustering depth = average number of micro-partitions that must be scanned to find all rows for a clustering key value\\\\\\\\n- **Ideal range: 1-10** (excellent clustering)\\\\\\\\n- **Acceptable range: 10-50** (decent clustering)\\\\\\\\n- **Your depth of 96 = poor clustering** (data is very scattered)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why your depth is so high:**\\\\\\\\n- Data is spread across many micro-partitions instead of being grouped together\\\\\\\\n- For your 1TB table, this means inefficient scanning\\\\\\\\n- Could be due to:\\\\\\\\n  - Recent large data loads without clustering maintenance\\\\\\\\n  - Poor clustering key choice (though TRANSACTION_DATE should be good)\\\\\\\\n  - Data insertion patterns that scatter dates across partitions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Immediate actions:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1. Check current clustering status:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION(\\'your_table\\', \\'(TRANSACTION_DATE)\\');\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2. Consider manual re-clustering (carefully):**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\n-- Only if absolutely necessary and during low-usage periods\\\\\\\\nALTER TABLE your_table RECLUSTER;\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3. Monitor the automatic clustering:**\\\\\\\\n- Snowflake\\'s automatic clustering should gradually improve this\\\\\\\\n- With 1TB, it may take days/weeks to fully optimize\\\\\\\\n- Check progress daily with the clustering information function\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Expected improvements:**\\\\\\\\n- Target depth should eventually reach 10-30 for your table size\\\\\\\\n- Query performance will improve significantly as depth decreases\\\\\\\\n- Partition pruning will become much more effective\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Warning:** Manual reclustering on a 1TB table will be expensive and time-consuming. Let automatic clustering work first, and only manually recluster if it\\'s not improving after a reasonable time period.\\\\\",\\\\\"User: which function should i use to check? i see there\\'s two\\\\\",\\\\\"Assistant: \\\\\\\\nYou\\'re right, there are two main functions. Here\\'s when to use each:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION() - Use this one for comprehensive analysis:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION(\\'your_table\\', \\'(TRANSACTION_DATE)\\');\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Returns detailed JSON with:**\\\\\\\\n- Clustering depth\\\\\\\\n- Overlap percentage  \\\\\\\\n- Total micro-partitions\\\\\\\\n- Clustered micro-partitions\\\\\\\\n- Average depth\\\\\\\\n- Notes and recommendations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH() - Use for quick depth check:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH(\\'your_table\\', \\'(TRANSACTION_DATE)\\');\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Returns only:**\\\\\\\\n- Simple clustering depth number (like your 96)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**My recommendation: Use SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION()**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor your situation with the high clustering depth of 96, you want the full picture. The comprehensive function will show you:\\\\\\\\n- Current overlap percentage (you mentioned it was high)\\\\\\\\n- How many partitions are actually clustered\\\\\\\\n- Progress over time as automatic clustering works\\\\\\\\n- Specific recommendations from Snowflake\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Example of what you\\'ll see:**\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\"cluster_by_keys\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\"(TRANSACTION_DATE)\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\"total_partition_count\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 15000,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\"total_constant_partition_count\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 1200,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\"average_overlaps\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 85.2,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\"average_depth\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 96.0,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\"partition_depth_histogram\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {...}\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse the comprehensive function to monitor your clustering progress as the automatic process works to reduce that depth from 96 to a more reasonable number.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\",\\\\\"User: What\\'s the differnce between these?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION(\\'PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED\\', \\'(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)\\');\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH(\\'PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED\\');\\\\\",\\\\\"Assistant: \\\\\\\\nHere are the key differences between those two functions:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION(\\'PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED\\', \\'(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)\\'):**\\\\\\\\n- **Detailed analysis** of clustering for the specific keys you specify\\\\\\\\n- Returns comprehensive JSON with metrics like overlap, depth, partition counts\\\\\\\\n- **Analyzes the compound clustering key** (both PLAIDACCOUNTID and TRANSACTIONDATE together)\\\\\\\\n- Shows how well data is clustered based on those specific columns\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH(\\'PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED\\'):**\\\\\\\\n- **Simple numeric result** - just the clustering depth\\\\\\\\n- **Uses the table\\'s actual defined clustering keys** (whatever was set with ALTER TABLE CLUSTER BY)\\\\\\\\n- No column specification needed - reads from table metadata\\\\\\\\n- Quick check of current clustering effectiveness\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Important observation:**\\\\\\\\nI notice you\\'re checking clustering info for **(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)** together, but earlier you were considering clustering on TRANSACTIONDATE only due to PLAIDACCOUNTID\\'s high cardinality (7.4M values).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Questions to consider:**\\\\\\\\n- Did you end up clustering on both columns?\\\\\\\\n- If so, that compound key might be why your clustering depth is 96\\\\\\\\n- The high cardinality PLAIDACCOUNTID could be fragmenting your clustering\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**To check what clustering keys are actually defined:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nSHOW TABLES LIKE \\'PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED\\';\\\\\\\\n-- Look at the CLUSTERING_KEY column\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Recommendation:**\\\\\\\\nCompare the clustering information for just TRANSACTIONDATE vs. the compound key to see which performs better:\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION(\\'PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED\\', \\'(TRANSACTIONDATE)\\');\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\",\\\\\"User: Yes im clustered on by in order (date, id) my depth now has gone down to 18\\\\\",\\\\\"Assistant: \\\\\\\\nThat\\'s excellent progress! Your clustering depth dropping from 96 to 18 is a **significant improvement** and shows the automatic clustering is working well.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What this means:**\\\\\\\\n- **Depth of 18 is good** for a 1TB table with compound clustering keys\\\\\\\\n- You\\'re now in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\"acceptable to good\\\\\\\\\\\\\" range (10-50)\\\\\\\\n- Query performance should be noticeably better\\\\\\\\n- Partition pruning is much more effective\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why the compound key (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID) is working:**\\\\\\\\n- **Date as the first key** provides the primary organization (smart choice)\\\\\\\\n- **ID as secondary** helps with account-specific queries without fragmenting too much\\\\\\\\n- The order matters - date first gives you the time-based benefits\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Expected benefits you should see:**\\\\\\\\n- Date range queries: Much faster scanning\\\\\\\\n- Account-specific queries: Better partition pruning\\\\\\\\n- Combined date + account filters: Excellent performance\\\\\\\\n- Overall query costs: Reduced due to less data scanning\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Monitoring going forward:**\\\\\\\\n- Depth might continue to improve slightly (target: 10-15 for optimal)\\\\\\\\n- Check overlap percentage - should also be decreasing\\\\\\\\n- Monitor query performance improvements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Bottom line:** Your clustering strategy is working well! The combination of low-cardinality date first, followed by high-cardinality ID, is proving effective for your data distribution. The automatic clustering process should continue to optimize this further, but you\\'re already seeing the major benefits.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGreat job on the clustering key selection and patience with the process!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\",\\\\\"User: does clustering change the size of Micropartiioons or just the order?\\\\\",\\\\\"Assistant: \\\\\\\\nClustering **reorganizes and can change the composition** of micro-partitions, not just their order. Here\\'s what actually happens:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What clustering does:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1. Reorganizes data physically:**\\\\\\\\n- Moves rows with similar clustering key values into the same micro-partitions\\\\\\\\n- Can **split and merge micro-partitions** to achieve better clustering\\\\\\\\n- Creates new micro-partitions with better data locality\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2. Micro-partition size effects:**\\\\\\\\n- **Size range stays the same** (50-500MB compressed, typically ~16MB)\\\\\\\\n- **Contents change** - similar clustering key values get grouped together\\\\\\\\n- May create new micro-partitions and mark old ones for deletion\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3. Physical changes:**\\\\\\\\n- **Not just reordering** - actual data reorganization\\\\\\\\n- Rows get physically moved between micro-partitions\\\\\\\\n- Better compression often results from grouping similar data\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Example of what happens:**\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nBefore clustering:\\\\\\\\nPartition 1: Dates [2023-01-01, 2023-06-15, 2023-12-31] + various accounts\\\\\\\\nPartition 2: Dates [2023-01-03, 2023-07-20, 2023-11-15] + various accounts\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter clustering:\\\\\\\\nPartition 1: Dates [2023-01-01, 2023-01-02, 2023-01-03] + related accounts  \\\\\\\\nPartition 2: Dates [2023-06-15, 2023-06-20, 2023-06-25] + related accounts\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Storage implications:**\\\\\\\\n- **Storage usage may temporarily increase** during clustering (old + new partitions)\\\\\\\\n- **Better compression** often results from grouping similar values\\\\\\\\n- **Metadata updates** to track new partition boundaries\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Performance benefits come from:**\\\\\\\\n- **Partition pruning** - skip irrelevant micro-partitions entirely\\\\\\\\n- **Better compression** - similar data compresses better\\\\\\\\n- **Reduced I/O** - related data stored together\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo clustering is much more than reordering - it\\'s a complete physical reorganization of how your data is stored in micro-partitions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\",\\\\\"User: how can i set use chaced result to false\\\\\",\\\\\"Assistant: \\\\\\\\nYou can disable cached results in several ways depending on your scope:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1. For your current session:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2. For a specific query:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nSELECT /*+ NO_CACHE */ * FROM your_table;\\\\\\\\n-- OR use the parameter in the query\\\\\\\\nSELECT * FROM your_table;\\\\\\\\n-- Run with USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE set for session\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3. For your user account (persists across sessions):**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nALTER USER your_username SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**4. At the warehouse level:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nALTER WAREHOUSE your_warehouse SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**5. Check current setting:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nSHOW PARAMETERS LIKE \\'USE_CACHED_RESULT\\';\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Most common approach:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\n-- Disable for current session\\\\\\\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- Run your queries...\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- Re-enable when done (optional)\\\\\\\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why you might want to disable caching:**\\\\\\\\n- Testing actual query performance (not cached performance)\\\\\\\\n- Ensuring fresh data retrieval\\\\\\\\n- Benchmarking clustering improvements\\\\\\\\n- Development/testing scenarios\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Note:** Disabling cached results will increase query costs and execution time since Snowflake won\\'t use previously computed results, but it gives you true performance metrics for your clustering optimization testing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\",\\\\\"User: show me syntax for a query\\\\\",\\\\\"Assistant: \\\\\\\\nI\\'d be happy to show you query syntax! Could you clarify what type of query you\\'re looking for? Here are some common examples based on our clustering discussion:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1.

They optimize for different query patterns.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**How they work together:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Clustering optimizes for:**\\\\\\\\n- Range queries (date ranges, numeric ranges)\\\\\\\\n- Equality filters on clustered columns\\\\\\\\n- Time-series analysis\\\\\\\\n- Partition pruning at the micro-partition level\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search Optimization optimizes for:**\\\\\\\\n- Point lookups (exact value searches)\\\\\\\\n- Substring searches\\\\\\\\n- High-cardinality equality filters\\\\\\\\n- Queries that don\\'t benefit much from clustering\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**For your PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED table:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Use clustering for:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\n-- These benefit from your (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID) clustering\\\\\\\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN \\'2023-01-01\\' AND \\'2023-03-31\\';\\\\\\\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = \\'2023-06-15\\' AND PLAIDACCOUNTID = \\'account123\\';\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Add search optimization for:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\n-- Enable search optimization\\\\\\\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- These would benefit from search optimization\\\\\\\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE DESCRIPTION ILIKE \\'%coffee%\\';\\\\\\\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE MERCHANT_NAME = \\'Starbucks\\';\\\\\\\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTION_ID = \\'specific_id\\';\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Best practice - use both:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\n-- Your existing clustering (keep this)\\\\\\\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- Add search optimization\\\\\\\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Cost considerations:**\\\\\\\\n- Clustering: Automatic maintenance cost\\\\\\\\n- Search optimization: Additional storage cost (~20-100% increase)\\\\\\\\n- Both provide query performance benefits that often offset costs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Bottom line:** Keep your clustering for date/account queries, and add search optimization for text searches and point lookups on other columns. They work together beautifully!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\",\\\\\"User: does it make sense to add search optimization on top of the clustering columns?\\\\\",\\\\\"Assistant: \\\\\\\\n**Generally no** - adding search optimization on top of clustering columns usually doesn\\'t make sense. Here\\'s why:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**For your clustering columns:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**TRANSACTIONDATE (2,700 unique values):**\\\\\\\\n- **Clustering already handles this well** for range queries and equality\\\\\\\\n- Search optimization would provide minimal additional benefit\\\\\\\\n- **Not worth the cost** - clustering gives you excellent partition pruning\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**PLAIDACCOUNTID (7.4M unique values):**\\\\\\\\n- **This might be an exception** - high cardinality can benefit from search optimization\\\\\\\\n- Clustering helps when combined with date, but search optimization could help for account-only queries\\\\\\\\n- **Consider it** if you frequently query by account ID alone\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Better approach - optimize non-clustered columns:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\n-- Keep your existing clustering\\\\\\\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- Add search optimization for OTHER columns that aren\\'t clustered\\\\\\\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION \\\\\\\\nON (DESCRIPTION, MERCHANT_NAME, CATEGORY, TRANSACTION_ID);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Cost/benefit analysis:**\\\\\\\\n- **Clustering columns**: Already optimized, search optimization = redundant cost\\\\\\\\n- **Non-clustered columns**: No optimization, search optimization = high value\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Exception case:**\\\\\\\\nIf you frequently run queries like:\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = \\'specific_account\\';  -- No date filter\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID might help, but test the performance improvement vs. cost.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Recommendation:** Skip search optimization on TRANSACTIONDATE, maybe consider it for PLAIDACCOUNTID if you have account-only queries, but definitely add it to other frequently-queried columns that aren\\'t clustered.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\",\\\\\"User: What does Percentage scanned from cache mean? I received a high number but i thought i turned off the cahce with that parameter\\\\\",\\\\\"Assistant: \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\" refers to **data cache** (warehouse cache), not **result cache** - these are different types of caching in Snowflake!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Two different cache types:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1. Result Cache (what you disabled):**\\\\\\\\n- `USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE` disables this\\\\\\\\n- Stores complete query results for 24 hours\\\\\\\\n- Avoids re-running identical queries entirely\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2. Data Cache/Warehouse Cache (still active):**\\\\\\\\n- **Cannot be disabled** - this is what \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\" measures\\\\\\\\n- Stores raw data in SSD cache on warehouse nodes\\\\\\\\n- Speeds up data retrieval from storage\\\\\\\\n- **This is good!** - you want high cache hit rates here\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What you\\'re seeing:**\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nPercentage scanned from cache: 85% (example)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\nThis means:\\\\\\\\n- 85% of data was read from fast SSD cache on warehouse\\\\\\\\n- 15% had to be fetched from slower remote storage\\\\\\\\n- **This is excellent performance** - high cache hit rate\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why this happens even with USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE:**\\\\\\\\n- Your query still runs (no result cache used)\\\\\\\\n- But data needed for the query comes from warehouse cache\\\\\\\\n- Especially common if you\\'re running similar queries or accessing same date ranges\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**What you disabled vs. what\\'s still working:**\\\\\\\\n- ❌ **Result cache**: Query won\\'t reuse previous identical results\\\\\\\\n- ✅ **Data cache**: Data blocks still cached in warehouse for faster access\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Bottom line:** High \\\\\\\\\\\\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is **good news** - it means your warehouse is efficiently caching frequently accessed data, making your clustering performance tests faster and more realistic for typical usage patterns.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\",\\\\\"User: So should I add search optimization or not on PLAIDACCOUNTID? It has 6.7 unique values. Right now cluster depth is 7 for CLUSTER BY (DATE, ID). THe query patterns will only be select * from table where ACCOUNTID= XXXXXXX and TRANSACTION_DATE is last 100 days or so\\\\\",\\\\\"Assistant: \\\\\\\\n**No, don\\'t add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID** for your use case. Here\\'s why:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Your query pattern is perfect for clustering:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nSELECT * FROM table \\\\\\\\nWHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = \\'XXXXXXX\\' \\\\\\\\n  AND TRANSACTIONDATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 100;\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why clustering already handles this optimally:**\\\\\\\\n- **Clustering depth of 7 is excellent** (ideal range is 1-10)\\\\\\\\n- Your compound clustering `(TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID)` is **perfectly designed** for this query pattern\\\\\\\\n- Date range (last 100 days) + specific account ID = **maximum clustering benefit**\\\\\\\\n- Snowflake will prune partitions based on both date range AND account ID\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Search optimization would be redundant because:**\\\\\\\\n- You\\'re **always filtering by both clustered columns**\\\\\\\\n- Clustering already provides excellent partition pruning\\\\\\\\n- Search optimization cost wouldn\\'t be justified\\\\\\\\n- Your depth of 7 shows clustering is working perfectly\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Cost/benefit analysis:**\\\\\\\\n- **Current clustering**: Handles your queries optimally (depth = 7)\\\\\\\\n- **Adding search optimization**: Extra storage cost (~20-100%) for minimal/no benefit\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Recommendation:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\n-- Keep your existing clustering (it\\'s working great!)\\\\\\\\n-- DON\\'T add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n-- Only consider search optimization for other columns if you query them:\\\\\\\\n-- ALTER TABLE ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (DESCRIPTION, MERCHANT_NAME);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Your clustering strategy is spot-on** for your query patterns. A depth of 7 with compound clustering for exactly the filters you use = perfect optimization. Don\\'t fix what isn\\'t broken!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\",\\\\\"User: I need to achieve low latency\\\\\",\\\\\"Assistant: \\\\\\\\nFor **low latency**, the calculation changes - you should **consider adding search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID**. Here\\'s why:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Low latency optimization strategy:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1. Keep your excellent clustering (depth 7 is great):**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\n-- Your current setup is already optimized\\\\\\\\nCLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID)\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2. Add search optimization for the account lookup:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Why this helps for low latency:**\\\\\\\\n- **Point lookup optimization**: Even with clustering, search optimization can make the account ID lookup faster\\\\\\\\n- **Micro-second improvements**: For low latency, every optimization counts\\\\\\\\n- **High cardinality benefit**: 6.7M unique values can benefit from search optimization\\'s indexing\\\\\\\\n- **Compound benefit**: Clustering + search optimization working together\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Additional low latency optimizations:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3. Warehouse sizing:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\n-- Use larger warehouse for lower latency\\\\\\\\nALTER WAREHOUSE your_warehouse SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = \\'LARGE\\'; -- or XL\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**4. Consider materialized views for common patterns:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW recent_transactions AS\\\\\\\\nSELECT * FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\\\\\\\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 100;\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**5. Enable result caching for repeated queries:**\\\\\\\\n```sql\\\\\\\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE; -- For production queries\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Cost vs. latency trade-off:**\\\\\\\\n- Search optimization cost: ~20-100% storage increase\\\\\\\\n- Latency improvement: Potentially 10-50% faster account lookups\\\\\\\\n- **For low latency requirements**: Usually worth it\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Bottom line:** Your clustering is excellent, but for true low latency, add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID. The combination of both optimizations will give you the fastest possible performance for your query pattern.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\",\\\\\"User: I want to create a copy of my table and then add search optimization to compare the differences.

      "    snow.ai.observability.agent.thread_id.messages: [\"User: can i create a clone of a table and add lcustering keys?\",\"Assistant: \\nYes, you can create a clone of a table and add clustering keys in Snowflake. Here are the main approaches:\\n\\n**Method 1: Clone first, then add clustering keys**\\n1. Create a clone of the existing table:\\n   ```sql\\n   CREATE TABLE new_table CLONE existing_table;\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Add clustering keys to the cloned table:\\n   ```sql\\n   ALTER TABLE new_table CLUSTER BY (column1, column2);\\n   ```\\n\\n**Method 2: Create clone with clustering keys in one step**\\nYou can also create a new table with clustering keys using CREATE TABLE AS SELECT:\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE new_table \\nCLUSTER BY (column1, column2) \\nAS SELECT * FROM existing_table;\\n```\\n\\n**Key considerations:**\\n- Cloning preserves the data and structure but not necessarily the clustering keys from the original table\\n- You can add clustering keys to any table after creation using ALTER TABLE\\n- Clustering keys help optimize query performance by physically organizing data\\n- You can specify up to 4 columns as clustering keys\\n- The clustering process happens automatically in the background after you define the keys\\n\\n**Benefits of adding clustering keys:**\\n- Improved query performance for filtered queries\\n- Better data pruning during query execution\\n- Reduced scan times for large tables\\n\\nThe clone operation is very fast since it uses Snowflake's zero-copy cloning feature, and adding clustering keys afterward will help optimize the table for your specific query patterns.\\n\",\"User: is if i have a transactiondate as type string sohuld i make it a date?\",\"Assistant: \\nYes, you should definitely convert a transaction date from string to date type. Here's why:\\n\\n**Benefits of using DATE data type:**\\n\\n**Performance advantages:**\\n- Date operations are much faster than string operations\\n- Better query optimization and indexing\\n- More efficient storage (dates take less space than strings)\\n- Improved clustering and partitioning performance\\n\\n**Functionality benefits:**\\n- Built-in date functions (DATE_TRUNC, DATEADD, DATEDIFF, etc.)\\n- Proper date arithmetic and comparisons\\n- Time zone handling capabilities\\n- Automatic validation of date values\\n\\n**Query improvements:**\\n- Range queries perform better (WHERE date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31')\\n- Date formatting functions work properly\\n- Aggregations by time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly) are easier\\n\\n**How to convert:**\\n```sql\\n-- Add new date column\\nALTER TABLE your_table ADD COLUMN transaction_date_new DATE;\\n\\n-- Convert string to date\\nUPDATE your_table \\nSET transaction_date_new = TRY_TO_DATE(transaction_date_string, 'YYYY-MM-DD');\\n\\n-- Check for conversion errors\\nSELECT * FROM your_table WHERE transaction_date_new IS NULL;\\n\\n-- Drop old column and rename new one\\nALTER TABLE your_table DROP COLUMN transaction_date_string;\\nALTER TABLE your_table RENAME COLUMN transaction_date_new TO transaction_date;\\n```\\n\\n**Important considerations:**\\n- Use TRY_TO_DATE() to handle invalid date strings gracefully\\n- Verify the date format in your string data first\\n- Check for any NULL values after conversion\\n- Consider if you need DATE, TIMESTAMP, or TIMESTAMP_TZ based on your requirements\\n\\nConverting to proper date types is almost always worth the effort for better performance and functionality.\\n\",\"User: does clustering take time? i just ran a cluster by and i am seeing very high overlap\",\"Assistant: \\nYes, clustering does take time, and seeing high overlap immediately after adding clustering keys is completely normal. Here's what's happening:\\n\\n**Why clustering takes time:**\\n- Clustering is an **asynchronous background process** that Snowflake runs automatically\\n- It doesn't happen instantly when you run `ALTER TABLE ... CLUSTER BY`\\n- The process reorganizes data physically based on your clustering keys\\n- Time depends on table size, data distribution, and system resources\\n\\n**What \\\"high overlap\\\" means:**\\n- Overlap measures how much data in different micro-partitions shares the same clustering key values\\n- **High overlap = poor clustering** (data is scattered across many micro-partitions)\\n- **Low overlap = good clustering** (similar values are grouped together)\\n- Right after adding clustering keys, overlap will be high because data hasn't been reorganized yet\\n\\n**What to expect:**\\n```sql\\n-- Check clustering information\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('your_table', '(column1, column2)');\\n\\n-- Monitor clustering depth and overlap over time\\nSHOW TABLES LIKE 'your_table';\\n-- Look at CLUSTERING_KEY and other clustering metrics\\n```\\n\\n**Timeline expectations:**\\n- Small tables (< 1GB): Minutes to hours\\n- Medium tables (1-100GB): Hours to days  \\n- Large tables (> 100GB): Days to weeks\\n- Process runs during low-activity periods to minimize impact\\n\\n**Best practices:**\\n- Be patient - let the automatic clustering process work\\n- Monitor progress with `SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION()`\\n- Don't re-cluster manually unless absolutely necessary\\n- Choose clustering keys wisely (commonly filtered columns)\\n\\nThe high overlap you're seeing should decrease over time as Snowflake's automatic clustering service reorganizes your data in the background.\\n\",\"User: Quesiton for you. This table is massive 1TB. TRANSACTION_DATE has cardinatlit of 2700 unique vlaues. ACCOUNT_ID has very high cardinality of 7.4 million unique values. Does it make sense to add a clustering key on both columns or only one?\",\"Assistant: \\nFor a 1TB table with those cardinality characteristics, I'd recommend **clustering on TRANSACTION_DATE only**, not both columns. Here's why:\\n\\n**Why TRANSACTION_DATE alone is better:**\\n\\n**Cardinality considerations:**\\n- 2,700 unique dates is ideal for clustering (good selectivity without being too granular)\\n- 7.4M unique ACCOUNT_IDs is extremely high cardinality - poor for clustering\\n- High cardinality clustering keys often provide minimal benefit and can hurt performance\\n\\n**Query pattern benefits:**\\n- Most analytical queries filter by date ranges (monthly/quarterly reports, time-based analysis)\\n- Date-based clustering enables excellent partition pruning\\n- Time-series data naturally benefits from chronological organization\\n\\n**Why not both columns:**\\n- **Compound clustering keys become less effective** with high cardinality columns\\n- ACCOUNT_ID's 7.4M values would create too much fragmentation\\n- The clustering maintenance overhead increases significantly\\n- Diminishing returns on query performance improvement\\n\\n**Recommended approach:**\\n```sql\\nALTER TABLE your_table CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTION_DATE);\\n```\\n\\n**Alternative considerations:**\\n- If you frequently query specific account ranges, consider **partitioning strategies** instead\\n- For account-specific queries, proper indexing or materialized views might be better\\n- Consider if ACCOUNT_ID has any patterns (geographic, categorical) that could be clustered instead\\n\\n**Expected benefits with date clustering:**\\n- Dramatic improvement for date range queries\\n- Better compression due to similar dates being stored together\\n- Faster aggregations by time periods\\n- Reduced scanning for time-based analytics\\n\\nThe 1TB size makes clustering even more valuable, but stick with the low-cardinality date column for maximum effectiveness.\\n\",\"User: my clustering depth on my table is 96\",\"Assistant: \\nA clustering depth of 96 is **very high** and indicates poor clustering. Here's what this means and what you should do:\\n\\n**What clustering depth means:**\\n- Clustering depth = average number of micro-partitions that must be scanned to find all rows for a clustering key value\\n- **Ideal range: 1-10** (excellent clustering)\\n- **Acceptable range: 10-50** (decent clustering)\\n- **Your depth of 96 = poor clustering** (data is very scattered)\\n\\n**Why your depth is so high:**\\n- Data is spread across many micro-partitions instead of being grouped together\\n- For your 1TB table, this means inefficient scanning\\n- Could be due to:\\n  - Recent large data loads without clustering maintenance\\n  - Poor clustering key choice (though TRANSACTION_DATE should be good)\\n  - Data insertion patterns that scatter dates across partitions\\n\\n**Immediate actions:**\\n\\n**1. Check current clustering status:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('your_table', '(TRANSACTION_DATE)');\\n```\\n\\n**2. Consider manual re-clustering (carefully):**\\n```sql\\n-- Only if absolutely necessary and during low-usage periods\\nALTER TABLE your_table RECLUSTER;\\n```\\n\\n**3. Monitor the automatic clustering:**\\n- Snowflake's automatic clustering should gradually improve this\\n- With 1TB, it may take days/weeks to fully optimize\\n- Check progress daily with the clustering information function\\n\\n**Expected improvements:**\\n- Target depth should eventually reach 10-30 for your table size\\n- Query performance will improve significantly as depth decreases\\n- Partition pruning will become much more effective\\n\\n**Warning:** Manual reclustering on a 1TB table will be expensive and time-consuming. Let automatic clustering work first, and only manually recluster if it's not improving after a reasonable time period.\",\"User: which function should i use to check? i see there's two\",\"Assistant: \\nYou're right, there are two main functions. Here's when to use each:\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION() - Use this one for comprehensive analysis:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('your_table', '(TRANSACTION_DATE)');\\n```\\n\\n**Returns detailed JSON with:**\\n- Clustering depth\\n- Overlap percentage  \\n- Total micro-partitions\\n- Clustered micro-partitions\\n- Average depth\\n- Notes and recommendations\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH() - Use for quick depth check:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('your_table', '(TRANSACTION_DATE)');\\n```\\n\\n**Returns only:**\\n- Simple clustering depth number (like your 96)\\n\\n**My recommendation: Use SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION()**\\n\\nFor your situation with the high clustering depth of 96, you want the full picture. The comprehensive function will show you:\\n- Current overlap percentage (you mentioned it was high)\\n- How many partitions are actually clustered\\n- Progress over time as automatic clustering works\\n- Specific recommendations from Snowflake\\n\\n**Example of what you'll see:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"cluster_by_keys\\\": \\\"(TRANSACTION_DATE)\\\",\\n  \\\"total_partition_count\\\": 15000,\\n  \\\"total_constant_partition_count\\\": 1200,\\n  \\\"average_overlaps\\\": 85.2,\\n  \\\"average_depth\\\": 96.0,\\n  \\\"partition_depth_histogram\\\": {...}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nUse the comprehensive function to monitor your clustering progress as the automatic process works to reduce that depth from 96 to a more reasonable number.\\n\",\"User: What's the differnce between these?\\n\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED', '(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)');\\n\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED');\",\"Assistant: \\nHere are the key differences between those two functions:\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED', '(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)'):**\\n- **Detailed analysis** of clustering for the specific keys you specify\\n- Returns comprehensive JSON with metrics like overlap, depth, partition counts\\n- **Analyzes the compound clustering key** (both PLAIDACCOUNTID and TRANSACTIONDATE together)\\n- Shows how well data is clustered based on those specific columns\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED'):**\\n- **Simple numeric result** - just the clustering depth\\n- **Uses the table's actual defined clustering keys** (whatever was set with ALTER TABLE CLUSTER BY)\\n- No column specification needed - reads from table metadata\\n- Quick check of current clustering effectiveness\\n\\n**Important observation:**\\nI notice you're checking clustering info for **(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)** together, but earlier you were considering clustering on TRANSACTIONDATE only due to PLAIDACCOUNTID's high cardinality (7.4M values).\\n\\n**Questions to consider:**\\n- Did you end up clustering on both columns?\\n- If so, that compound key might be why your clustering depth is 96\\n- The high cardinality PLAIDACCOUNTID could be fragmenting your clustering\\n\\n**To check what clustering keys are actually defined:**\\n```sql\\nSHOW TABLES LIKE 'PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED';\\n-- Look at the CLUSTERING_KEY column\\n```\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\nCompare the clustering information for just TRANSACTIONDATE vs. the compound key to see which performs better:\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED', '(TRANSACTIONDATE)');\\n```\",\"User: Yes im clustered on by in order (date, id) my depth now has gone down to 18\",\"Assistant: \\nThat's excellent progress! Your clustering depth dropping from 96 to 18 is a **significant improvement** and shows the automatic clustering is working well.\\n\\n**What this means:**\\n- **Depth of 18 is good** for a 1TB table with compound clustering keys\\n- You're now in the \\\"acceptable to good\\\" range (10-50)\\n- Query performance should be noticeably better\\n- Partition pruning is much more effective\\n\\n**Why the compound key (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID) is working:**\\n- **Date as the first key** provides the primary organization (smart choice)\\n- **ID as secondary** helps with account-specific queries without fragmenting too much\\n- The order matters - date first gives you the time-based benefits\\n\\n**Expected benefits you should see:**\\n- Date range queries: Much faster scanning\\n- Account-specific queries: Better partition pruning\\n- Combined date + account filters: Excellent performance\\n- Overall query costs: Reduced due to less data scanning\\n\\n**Monitoring going forward:**\\n- Depth might continue to improve slightly (target: 10-15 for optimal)\\n- Check overlap percentage - should also be decreasing\\n- Monitor query performance improvements\\n\\n**Bottom line:** Your clustering strategy is working well! The combination of low-cardinality date first, followed by high-cardinality ID, is proving effective for your data distribution. The automatic clustering process should continue to optimize this further, but you're already seeing the major benefits.\\n\\nGreat job on the clustering key selection and patience with the process!\\n\",\"User: does clustering change the size of Micropartiioons or just the order?\",\"Assistant: \\nClustering **reorganizes and can change the composition** of micro-partitions, not just their order. Here's what actually happens:\\n\\n**What clustering does:**\\n\\n**1. Reorganizes data physically:**\\n- Moves rows with similar clustering key values into the same micro-partitions\\n- Can **split and merge micro-partitions** to achieve better clustering\\n- Creates new micro-partitions with better data locality\\n\\n**2. Micro-partition size effects:**\\n- **Size range stays the same** (50-500MB compressed, typically ~16MB)\\n- **Contents change** - similar clustering key values get grouped together\\n- May create new micro-partitions and mark old ones for deletion\\n\\n**3. Physical changes:**\\n- **Not just reordering** - actual data reorganization\\n- Rows get physically moved between micro-partitions\\n- Better compression often results from grouping similar data\\n\\n**Example of what happens:**\\n```\\nBefore clustering:\\nPartition 1: Dates [2023-01-01, 2023-06-15, 2023-12-31] + various accounts\\nPartition 2: Dates [2023-01-03, 2023-07-20, 2023-11-15] + various accounts\\n\\nAfter clustering:\\nPartition 1: Dates [2023-01-01, 2023-01-02, 2023-01-03] + related accounts  \\nPartition 2: Dates [2023-06-15, 2023-06-20, 2023-06-25] + related accounts\\n```\\n\\n**Storage implications:**\\n- **Storage usage may temporarily increase** during clustering (old + new partitions)\\n- **Better compression** often results from grouping similar values\\n- **Metadata updates** to track new partition boundaries\\n\\n**Performance benefits come from:**\\n- **Partition pruning** - skip irrelevant micro-partitions entirely\\n- **Better compression** - similar data compresses better\\n- **Reduced I/O** - related data stored together\\n\\nSo clustering is much more than reordering - it's a complete physical reorganization of how your data is stored in micro-partitions.\\n\",\"User: how can i set use chaced result to false\",\"Assistant: \\nYou can disable cached results in several ways depending on your scope:\\n\\n**1. For your current session:**\\n```sql\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n```\\n\\n**2. For a specific query:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT /*+ NO_CACHE */ * FROM your_table;\\n-- OR use the parameter in the query\\nSELECT * FROM your_table;\\n-- Run with USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE set for session\\n```\\n\\n**3. For your user account (persists across sessions):**\\n```sql\\nALTER USER your_username SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n```\\n\\n**4. At the warehouse level:**\\n```sql\\nALTER WAREHOUSE your_warehouse SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n```\\n\\n**5. Check current setting:**\\n```sql\\nSHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'USE_CACHED_RESULT';\\n```\\n\\n**Most common approach:**\\n```sql\\n-- Disable for current session\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n\\n-- Run your queries...\\n\\n-- Re-enable when done (optional)\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;\\n```\\n\\n**Why you might want to disable caching:**\\n- Testing actual query performance (not cached performance)\\n- Ensuring fresh data retrieval\\n- Benchmarking clustering improvements\\n- Development/testing scenarios\\n\\n**Note:** Disabling cached results will increase query costs and execution time since Snowflake won't use previously computed results, but it gives you true performance metrics for your clustering optimization testing.\\n\",\"User: show me syntax for a query\",\"Assistant: \\nI'd be happy to show you query syntax! Could you clarify what type of query you're looking for? Here are some common examples based on our clustering discussion:\\n\\n**1. Test clustering performance (date range query):**\\n```sql\\nSELECT COUNT(*), \\n       MIN(TRANSACTIONDATE), \\n       MAX(TRANSACTIONDATE),\\n       COUNT(DISTINCT PLAIDACCOUNTID)\\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31';\\n```\\n\\n**2. Account-specific query:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT TRANSACTIONDATE, \\n       AMOUNT, \\n       DESCRIPTION\\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'specific_account_id'\\n  AND TRANSACTIONDATE >= '2023-01-01'\\nORDER BY TRANSACTIONDATE DESC;\\n```\\n\\n**3. Aggregation by date:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TRANSACTIONDATE) as month,\\n       COUNT(*) as transaction_count,\\n       SUM(AMOUNT) as total_amount\\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE >= '2023-01-01'\\nGROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TRANSACTIONDATE)\\nORDER BY month;\\n```\\n\\n**4. Basic table exploration:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT * \\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nLIMIT 100;\\n```\\n\\nWhich type of query syntax were you looking for, or did you have something specific in mind?\\n\",\"User: no sorry using ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE; in a query\",\"Assistant: \\nHere's the syntax for using `ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE` with queries:\\n\\n**Option 1: Set session parameter, then run query:**\\n```sql\\n-- Disable cached results for the session\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n\\n-- Then run your query\\nSELECT COUNT(*), \\n       MIN(TRANSACTIONDATE), \\n       MAX(TRANSACTIONDATE)\\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31';\\n```\\n\\n**Option 2: Multiple statements in sequence:**\\n```sql\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n\\nSELECT * FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'some_account_id' \\n  AND TRANSACTIONDATE >= '2023-01-01'\\nLIMIT 1000;\\n\\n-- Re-enable caching when done (optional)\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;\\n```\\n\\n**Option 3: In a script/batch:**\\n```sql\\n-- Disable caching\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n\\n-- Test clustering performance\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED', '(TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID)');\\n\\n-- Run performance test query\\nSELECT COUNT(*) \\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15';\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** The `ALTER SESSION` command affects the entire session, so all subsequent queries in that session will not use cached results until you change it back or start a new session.\\n\",\"User: ignore alter session i want SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE used within a query\",\"Assistant: \\nYou cannot use `SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE` directly **within** a SELECT query, but here are the ways to disable caching for a specific query:\\n\\n**Option 1: SET statement before query (single execution):**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15';\\n```\\n\\n**Option 2: Using query hint (if supported):**\\n```sql\\nSELECT /*+ NO_CACHE */ COUNT(*) \\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15';\\n```\\n\\n**Option 3: Multi-statement execution:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\nSELECT * FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED LIMIT 10;\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;\\n```\\n\\n**What WON'T work:**\\n```sql\\n-- This is invalid syntax\\nSELECT COUNT(*), SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE \\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED;\\n```\\n\\nThe `SET` command must be executed as a separate statement before your query runs. Snowflake doesn't allow parameter setting within the SELECT statement itself.\\n\\n**Most practical approach:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n-- Your query here\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';\\n```\",\"User: will this work in a worksheet?\",\"Assistant: \\nYes, it will work in a Snowflake worksheet! Here's how:\\n\\n**In a Snowflake worksheet, you can run:**\\n\\n**Option 1: Select and run both statements together:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15';\\n```\\n- Highlight both lines and click \\\"Run\\\"\\n- Or put cursor anywhere and run all statements\\n\\n**Option 2: Run statements separately:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n```\\nRun this first, then run:\\n```sql\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15';\\n```\\n\\n**Important worksheet behavior:**\\n- The `SET` command affects your **entire worksheet session**\\n- Once set to FALSE, all subsequent queries in that worksheet won't use cache\\n- Persists until you close the worksheet or set it back to TRUE\\n- Each worksheet has its own session scope\\n\\n**To reset caching in the same worksheet:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;\\n```\\n\\n**Pro tip for testing:**\\n```sql\\n-- Disable caching\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n\\n-- Test your clustering performance\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31';\\n\\n-- Re-enable caching when done\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;\\n```\\n\\nThis is perfect for testing your clustering improvements without cached results interfering!\\n\",\"User: is search optimization and clustering complementary or should i only use one or the other?\",\"Assistant: \\nSearch Optimization and clustering are **complementary** - you can and often should use both together! They optimize for different query patterns.\\n\\n**How they work together:**\\n\\n**Clustering optimizes for:**\\n- Range queries (date ranges, numeric ranges)\\n- Equality filters on clustered columns\\n- Time-series analysis\\n- Partition pruning at the micro-partition level\\n\\n**Search Optimization optimizes for:**\\n- Point lookups (exact value searches)\\n- Substring searches\\n- High-cardinality equality filters\\n- Queries that don't benefit much from clustering\\n\\n**For your PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED table:**\\n\\n**Use clustering for:**\\n```sql\\n-- These benefit from your (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID) clustering\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31';\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15' AND PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'account123';\\n```\\n\\n**Add search optimization for:**\\n```sql\\n-- Enable search optimization\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;\\n\\n-- These would benefit from search optimization\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE DESCRIPTION ILIKE '%coffee%';\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE MERCHANT_NAME = 'Starbucks';\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTION_ID = 'specific_id';\\n```\\n\\n**Best practice - use both:**\\n```sql\\n-- Your existing clustering (keep this)\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n\\n-- Add search optimization\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;\\n```\\n\\n**Cost considerations:**\\n- Clustering: Automatic maintenance cost\\n- Search optimization: Additional storage cost (~20-100% increase)\\n- Both provide query performance benefits that often offset costs\\n\\n**Bottom line:** Keep your clustering for date/account queries, and add search optimization for text searches and point lookups on other columns. They work together beautifully!\\n\",\"User: does it make sense to add search optimization on top of the clustering columns?\",\"Assistant: \\n**Generally no** - adding search optimization on top of clustering columns usually doesn't make sense. Here's why:\\n\\n**For your clustering columns:**\\n\\n**TRANSACTIONDATE (2,700 unique values):**\\n- **Clustering already handles this well** for range queries and equality\\n- Search optimization would provide minimal additional benefit\\n- **Not worth the cost** - clustering gives you excellent partition pruning\\n\\n**PLAIDACCOUNTID (7.4M unique values):**\\n- **This might be an exception** - high cardinality can benefit from search optimization\\n- Clustering helps when combined with date, but search optimization could help for account-only queries\\n- **Consider it** if you frequently query by account ID alone\\n\\n**Better approach - optimize non-clustered columns:**\\n```sql\\n-- Keep your existing clustering\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n\\n-- Add search optimization for OTHER columns that aren't clustered\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION \\nON (DESCRIPTION, MERCHANT_NAME, CATEGORY, TRANSACTION_ID);\\n```\\n\\n**Cost/benefit analysis:**\\n- **Clustering columns**: Already optimized, search optimization = redundant cost\\n- **Non-clustered columns**: No optimization, search optimization = high value\\n\\n**Exception case:**\\nIf you frequently run queries like:\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'specific_account';  -- No date filter\\n```\\n\\nThen search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID might help, but test the performance improvement vs. cost.\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Skip search optimization on TRANSACTIONDATE, maybe consider it for PLAIDACCOUNTID if you have account-only queries, but definitely add it to other frequently-queried columns that aren't clustered.\\n\",\"User: What does Percentage scanned from cache mean? I received a high number but i thought i turned off the cahce with that parameter\",\"Assistant: \\n\\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" refers to **data cache** (warehouse cache), not **result cache** - these are different types of caching in Snowflake!\\n\\n**Two different cache types:**\\n\\n**1. Result Cache (what you disabled):**\\n- `USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE` disables this\\n- Stores complete query results for 24 hours\\n- Avoids re-running identical queries entirely\\n\\n**2. Data Cache/Warehouse Cache (still active):**\\n- **Cannot be disabled** - this is what \\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" measures\\n- Stores raw data in SSD cache on warehouse nodes\\n- Speeds up data retrieval from storage\\n- **This is good!** - you want high cache hit rates here\\n\\n**What you're seeing:**\\n```\\nPercentage scanned from cache: 85% (example)\\n```\\nThis means:\\n- 85% of data was read from fast SSD cache on warehouse\\n- 15% had to be fetched from slower remote storage\\n- **This is excellent performance** - high cache hit rate\\n\\n**Why this happens even with USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE:**\\n- Your query still runs (no result cache used)\\n- But data needed for the query comes from warehouse cache\\n- Especially common if you're running similar queries or accessing same date ranges\\n\\n**What you disabled vs. what's still working:**\\n- ❌ **Result cache**: Query won't reuse previous identical results\\n- ✅ **Data cache**: Data blocks still cached in warehouse for faster access\\n\\n**Bottom line:** High \\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" is **good news** - it means your warehouse is efficiently caching frequently accessed data, making your clustering performance tests faster and more realistic for typical usage patterns.\\n\",\"User: So should I add search optimization or not on PLAIDACCOUNTID? It has 6.7 unique values. Right now cluster depth is 7 for CLUSTER BY (DATE, ID). THe query patterns will only be select * from table where ACCOUNTID= XXXXXXX and TRANSACTION_DATE is last 100 days or so\",\"Assistant: \\n**No, don't add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID** for your use case. Here's why:\\n\\n**Your query pattern is perfect for clustering:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM table \\nWHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'XXXXXXX' \\n  AND TRANSACTIONDATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 100;\\n```\\n\\n**Why clustering already handles this optimally:**\\n- **Clustering depth of 7 is excellent** (ideal range is 1-10)\\n- Your compound clustering `(TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID)` is **perfectly designed** for this query pattern\\n- Date range (last 100 days) + specific account ID = **maximum clustering benefit**\\n- Snowflake will prune partitions based on both date range AND account ID\\n\\n**Search optimization would be redundant because:**\\n- You're **always filtering by both clustered columns**\\n- Clustering already provides excellent partition pruning\\n- Search optimization cost wouldn't be justified\\n- Your depth of 7 shows clustering is working perfectly\\n\\n**Cost/benefit analysis:**\\n- **Current clustering**: Handles your queries optimally (depth = 7)\\n- **Adding search optimization**: Extra storage cost (~20-100%) for minimal/no benefit\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\n```sql\\n-- Keep your existing clustering (it's working great!)\\n-- DON'T add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID\\n\\n-- Only consider search optimization for other columns if you query them:\\n-- ALTER TABLE ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (DESCRIPTION, MERCHANT_NAME);\\n```\\n\\n**Your clustering strategy is spot-on** for your query patterns. A depth of 7 with compound clustering for exactly the filters you use = perfect optimization. Don't fix what isn't broken!\\n\",\"User: I need to achieve low latency\",\"Assistant: \\nFor **low latency**, the calculation changes - you should **consider adding search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID**. Here's why:\\n\\n**Low latency optimization strategy:**\\n\\n**1. Keep your excellent clustering (depth 7 is great):**\\n```sql\\n-- Your current setup is already optimized\\nCLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID)\\n```\\n\\n**2. Add search optimization for the account lookup:**\\n```sql\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n```\\n\\n**Why this helps for low latency:**\\n- **Point lookup optimization**: Even with clustering, search optimization can make the account ID lookup faster\\n- **Micro-second improvements**: For low latency, every optimization counts\\n- **High cardinality benefit**: 6.7M unique values can benefit from search optimization's indexing\\n- **Compound benefit**: Clustering + search optimization working together\\n\\n**Additional low latency optimizations:**\\n\\n**3. Warehouse sizing:**\\n```sql\\n-- Use larger warehouse for lower latency\\nALTER WAREHOUSE your_warehouse SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE'; -- or XL\\n```\\n\\n**4. Consider materialized views for common patterns:**\\n```sql\\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW recent_transactions AS\\nSELECT * FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 100;\\n```\\n\\n**5. Enable result caching for repeated queries:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE; -- For production queries\\n```\\n\\n**Cost vs. latency trade-off:**\\n- Search optimization cost: ~20-100% storage increase\\n- Latency improvement: Potentially 10-50% faster account lookups\\n- **For low latency requirements**: Usually worth it\\n\\n**Bottom line:** Your clustering is excellent, but for true low latency, add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID. The combination of both optimizations will give you the fastest possible performance for your query pattern.\\n\",\"User: I want to create a copy of my table and then add search optimization to compare the differences. How could i do this?\",\"Assistant: \\nGreat approach for A/B testing! Here's how to create a copy and compare performance:\\n\\n**Step 1: Create a clone of your table**\\n```sql\\n-- Clone preserves data, structure, and clustering keys\\nCREATE TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST \\nCLONE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED;\\n```\\n\\n**Step 2: Add search optimization to the clone**\\n```sql\\n-- Add search optimization to the test table\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST \\nADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n```\\n\\n**Step 3: Wait for search optimization to build**\\n```sql\\n-- Check search optimization status\\nSELECT SYSTEM$GET_SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_STATUS('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST');\\n-- Wait until it shows \\\"ENABLED\\\" and build is complete\\n```\\n\\n**Step 4: Performance comparison queries**\\n```sql\\n-- Disable result caching for accurate comparison\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n\\n-- Test original table (clustering only)\\nSELECT * FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'test_account_id' \\n  AND TRANSACTIONDATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 100;\\n\\n-- Test clone with search optimization (clustering + search opt)\\nSELECT * FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST \\nWHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'test_account_id' \\n  AND TRANSACTIONDATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 100;\\n```\\n\\n**Step 5: Compare metrics**\\nLook at query profile for both queries:\\n- Execution time\\n- Data scanned\\n- Partitions scanned\\n- Bytes scanned\\n\\n**Step 6: Clean up when done**\\n```sql\\n-- Drop test table after comparison\\nDROP TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST;\\n```\\n\\n**Pro tip:** Run multiple test queries with different account IDs to get average performance improvements!\\n\",\"User: Will my clone have the same clustering?\",\"Assistant: \\n**Yes, your clone will have the same clustering keys**, but there are some important details:\\n\\n**What gets preserved in the clone:**\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST \\nCLONE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED;\\n```\\n\\n✅ **Clustering key definition**: `CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID)`  \\n✅ **Data and structure**: Exact copy of all rows  \\n✅ **Physical clustering state**: The actual clustering depth and organization  \\n\\n**Verify clustering was preserved:**\\n```sql\\n-- Check clustering keys are the same\\nSHOW TABLES LIKE 'PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED%';\\n-- Look at CLUSTERING_KEY column for both tables\\n\\n-- Check clustering depth is the same\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED');\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST');\\n```\\n\\n**What this means for your test:**\\n- **Perfect A/B test setup**: Both tables have identical clustering (depth ~7)\\n- **Only difference**: Search optimization on the clone\\n- **Fair comparison**: Any performance difference is purely from search optimization\\n\\n**Expected results:**\\n```sql\\n-- Both should show same clustering depth\\nOriginal table clustering depth: 7\\nClone table clustering depth: 7\\n\\n-- Both should have same clustering keys\\nCLUSTERING_KEY: (TRANSACTIONDATE,PLAIDACCOUNTID)\\n```\\n\\n**Bottom line:** Your clone is a perfect copy with identical clustering, making it ideal for testing whether search optimization provides additional benefits on top of your already well-clustered table.\\n\",\"User: how do i add the search optimization path on plaidaccountid\",\"Assistant: \\nHere's the exact syntax to add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID:\\n\\n```sql\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST \\nADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n```\\n\\n**To check if it was added successfully:**\\n```sql\\n-- Check search optimization status\\nSHOW TABLES LIKE 'PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST';\\n-- Look for SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION column\\n\\n-- Or check detailed status\\nSELECT SYSTEM$GET_SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_STATUS('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST');\\n```\\n\\n**Monitor the build progress:**\\n```sql\\n-- This will show build status and progress\\nSELECT SYSTEM$GET_SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_STATUS('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST');\\n\\n-- Status will show something like:\\n-- \\\"BUILDING\\\" -> \\\"ENABLED\\\" when complete\\n```\\n\\n**If you want to add multiple columns:**\\n```sql\\n-- Multiple columns syntax\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST \\nADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (PLAIDACCOUNTID, DESCRIPTION, MERCHANT_NAME);\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** The search optimization build process will take time (potentially hours for a 1TB table), so be patient before running your performance comparison tests.

This appears to be a technical question about Snowflake database functionality, specifically about table cloning and clustering keys. \\n\\nThis is not a question that requires querying data from the available semantic models (Workday_Orgchart) or searching through documents. This is more of a \\\"how-to\\\" or system capability question about Snowflake features.\\n\\nSince this is asking about system capabilities and Snowflake functionality, I should answer based on my knowledge of Snowflake's features regarding table cloning and clustering keys.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nYes, you can create a clone of a table and add clustering keys in Snowflake. Here are the main approaches:\\n\\n**Method 1: Clone first, then add clustering keys**\\n1. Create a clone of the existing table:\\n   ```sql\\n   CREATE TABLE new_table CLONE existing_table;\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Add clustering keys to the cloned table:\\n   ```sql\\n   ALTER TABLE new_table CLUSTER BY (column1, column2);\\n   ```\\n\\n**Method 2: Create clone with clustering keys in one step**\\nYou can also create a new table with clustering keys using CREATE TABLE AS SELECT:\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE new_table \\nCLUSTER BY (column1, column2) \\nAS SELECT * FROM existing_table;\\n```\\n\\n**Key considerations:**\\n- Cloning preserves the data and structure but not necessarily the clustering keys from the original table\\n- You can add clustering keys to any table after creation using ALTER TABLE\\n- Clustering keys help optimize query performance by physically organizing data\\n- You can specify up to 4 columns as clustering keys\\n- The clustering process happens automatically in the background after you define the keys\\n\\n**Benefits of adding clustering keys:**\\n- Improved query performance for filtered queries\\n- Better data pruning during query execution\\n- Reduced scan times for large tables\\n\\nThe clone operation is very fast since it uses Snowflake's zero-copy cloning feature, and adding clustering keys afterward will help optimize the table for your specific query patterns.\\n</answer>\",\"User: is if i have a transactiondate as type string sohuld i make it a date?\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about whether they should convert a transaction date column from string type to date type. This is a data modeling and database design question about data types in Snowflake. This doesn't require querying any of the available semantic models or searching documents - it's a best practices question about data types.\\n\\nI should provide guidance on the benefits of using proper date data types versus string types for date information.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nYes, you should definitely convert a transaction date from string to date type. Here's why:\\n\\n**Benefits of using DATE data type:**\\n\\n**Performance advantages:**\\n- Date operations are much faster than string operations\\n- Better query optimization and indexing\\n- More efficient storage (dates take less space than strings)\\n- Improved clustering and partitioning performance\\n\\n**Functionality benefits:**\\n- Built-in date functions (DATE_TRUNC, DATEADD, DATEDIFF, etc.)\\n- Proper date arithmetic and comparisons\\n- Time zone handling capabilities\\n- Automatic validation of date values\\n\\n**Query improvements:**\\n- Range queries perform better (WHERE date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31')\\n- Date formatting functions work properly\\n- Aggregations by time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly) are easier\\n\\n**How to convert:**\\n```sql\\n-- Add new date column\\nALTER TABLE your_table ADD COLUMN transaction_date_new DATE;\\n\\n-- Convert string to date\\nUPDATE your_table \\nSET transaction_date_new = TRY_TO_DATE(transaction_date_string, 'YYYY-MM-DD');\\n\\n-- Check for conversion errors\\nSELECT * FROM your_table WHERE transaction_date_new IS NULL;\\n\\n-- Drop old column and rename new one\\nALTER TABLE your_table DROP COLUMN transaction_date_string;\\nALTER TABLE your_table RENAME COLUMN transaction_date_new TO transaction_date;\\n```\\n\\n**Important considerations:**\\n- Use TRY_TO_DATE() to handle invalid date strings gracefully\\n- Verify the date format in your string data first\\n- Check for any NULL values after conversion\\n- Consider if you need DATE, TIMESTAMP, or TIMESTAMP_TZ based on your requirements\\n\\nConverting to proper date types is almost always worth the effort for better performance and functionality.\\n</answer>\",\"User: does clustering take time? i just ran a cluster by and i am seeing very high overlap\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about clustering performance and mentions they're seeing \\\"very high overlap\\\" after running a CLUSTER BY command. This is a question about Snowflake's clustering feature, specifically about:\\n\\n1. Whether clustering takes time to complete\\n2. What \\\"high overlap\\\" means in the context of clustering\\n3. Likely asking for guidance on what to expect and how to interpret clustering metrics\\n\\nThis is a technical question about Snowflake functionality, not requiring data queries from the semantic models or document searches.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nYes, clustering does take time, and seeing high overlap immediately after adding clustering keys is completely normal. Here's what's happening:\\n\\n**Why clustering takes time:**\\n- Clustering is an **asynchronous background process** that Snowflake runs automatically\\n- It doesn't happen instantly when you run `ALTER TABLE ... CLUSTER BY`\\n- The process reorganizes data physically based on your clustering keys\\n- Time depends on table size, data distribution, and system resources\\n\\n**What \\\"high overlap\\\" means:**\\n- Overlap measures how much data in different micro-partitions shares the same clustering key values\\n- **High overlap = poor clustering** (data is scattered across many micro-partitions)\\n- **Low overlap = good clustering** (similar values are grouped together)\\n- Right after adding clustering keys, overlap will be high because data hasn't been reorganized yet\\n\\n**What to expect:**\\n```sql\\n-- Check clustering information\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('your_table', '(column1, column2)');\\n\\n-- Monitor clustering depth and overlap over time\\nSHOW TABLES LIKE 'your_table';\\n-- Look at CLUSTERING_KEY and other clustering metrics\\n```\\n\\n**Timeline expectations:**\\n- Small tables (< 1GB): Minutes to hours\\n- Medium tables (1-100GB): Hours to days  \\n- Large tables (> 100GB): Days to weeks\\n- Process runs during low-activity periods to minimize impact\\n\\n**Best practices:**\\n- Be patient - let the automatic clustering process work\\n- Monitor progress with `SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION()`\\n- Don't re-cluster manually unless absolutely necessary\\n- Choose clustering keys wisely (commonly filtered columns)\\n\\nThe high overlap you're seeing should decrease over time as Snowflake's automatic clustering service reorganizes your data in the background.\\n</answer>\",\"User: Quesiton for you. This table is massive 1TB. TRANSACTION_DATE has cardinatlit of 2700 unique vlaues. ACCOUNT_ID has very high cardinality of 7.4 million unique values. Does it make sense to add a clustering key on both columns or only one?\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about clustering strategy for a very large table (1TB) with two potential clustering key columns:\\n- TRANSACTION_DATE: Low cardinality (2,700 unique values)\\n- ACCOUNT_ID: Very high cardinality (7.4 million unique values)\\n\\nThis is a question about Snowflake clustering best practices and strategy. I need to consider:\\n1. The size of the table (1TB is very large)\\n2. The cardinality differences between the columns\\n3. How clustering works with different cardinality levels\\n4. Query patterns that would benefit from clustering\\n5. Snowflake's recommendations for clustering key selection\\n\\nThis doesn't require querying data or searching documents - it's about database optimization strategy.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nFor a 1TB table with those cardinality characteristics, I'd recommend **clustering on TRANSACTION_DATE only**, not both columns. Here's why:\\n\\n**Why TRANSACTION_DATE alone is better:**\\n\\n**Cardinality considerations:**\\n- 2,700 unique dates is ideal for clustering (good selectivity without being too granular)\\n- 7.4M unique ACCOUNT_IDs is extremely high cardinality - poor for clustering\\n- High cardinality clustering keys often provide minimal benefit and can hurt performance\\n\\n**Query pattern benefits:**\\n- Most analytical queries filter by date ranges (monthly/quarterly reports, time-based analysis)\\n- Date-based clustering enables excellent partition pruning\\n- Time-series data naturally benefits from chronological organization\\n\\n**Why not both columns:**\\n- **Compound clustering keys become less effective** with high cardinality columns\\n- ACCOUNT_ID's 7.4M values would create too much fragmentation\\n- The clustering maintenance overhead increases significantly\\n- Diminishing returns on query performance improvement\\n\\n**Recommended approach:**\\n```sql\\nALTER TABLE your_table CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTION_DATE);\\n```\\n\\n**Alternative considerations:**\\n- If you frequently query specific account ranges, consider **partitioning strategies** instead\\n- For account-specific queries, proper indexing or materialized views might be better\\n- Consider if ACCOUNT_ID has any patterns (geographic, categorical) that could be clustered instead\\n\\n**Expected benefits with date clustering:**\\n- Dramatic improvement for date range queries\\n- Better compression due to similar dates being stored together\\n- Faster aggregations by time periods\\n- Reduced scanning for time-based analytics\\n\\nThe 1TB size makes clustering even more valuable, but stick with the low-cardinality date column for maximum effectiveness.\\n</answer>\",\"User: my clustering depth on my table is 96\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is reporting that their clustering depth is 96. This is a very high clustering depth number, and I need to explain what this means and provide guidance.\\n\\nClustering depth in Snowflake indicates how many micro-partitions need to be scanned on average to find all values for a clustering key. A depth of 96 is quite high and suggests poor clustering.\\n\\nThis is about Snowflake clustering metrics and optimization, so I should explain what this means and provide actionable advice.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nA clustering depth of 96 is **very high** and indicates poor clustering. Here's what this means and what you should do:\\n\\n**What clustering depth means:**\\n- Clustering depth = average number of micro-partitions that must be scanned to find all rows for a clustering key value\\n- **Ideal range: 1-10** (excellent clustering)\\n- **Acceptable range: 10-50** (decent clustering)\\n- **Your depth of 96 = poor clustering** (data is very scattered)\\n\\n**Why your depth is so high:**\\n- Data is spread across many micro-partitions instead of being grouped together\\n- For your 1TB table, this means inefficient scanning\\n- Could be due to:\\n  - Recent large data loads without clustering maintenance\\n  - Poor clustering key choice (though TRANSACTION_DATE should be good)\\n  - Data insertion patterns that scatter dates across partitions\\n\\n**Immediate actions:**\\n\\n**1. Check current clustering status:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('your_table', '(TRANSACTION_DATE)');\\n```\\n\\n**2. Consider manual re-clustering (carefully):**\\n```sql\\n-- Only if absolutely necessary and during low-usage periods\\nALTER TABLE your_table RECLUSTER;\\n```\\n\\n**3. Monitor the automatic clustering:**\\n- Snowflake's automatic clustering should gradually improve this\\n- With 1TB, it may take days/weeks to fully optimize\\n- Check progress daily with the clustering information function\\n\\n**Expected improvements:**\\n- Target depth should eventually reach 10-30 for your table size\\n- Query performance will improve significantly as depth decreases\\n- Partition pruning will become much more effective\\n\\n**Warning:** Manual reclustering on a 1TB table will be expensive and time-consuming. Let automatic clustering work first, and only manually recluster if it's not improving after a reasonable time period.</answer>\",\"User: which function should i use to check? i see there's two\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about which function to use to check clustering information, and they mention there are two functions. In Snowflake, there are indeed two main functions for checking clustering information:\\n\\n1. SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION() - provides detailed clustering metrics\\n2. SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH() - provides just the clustering depth\\n\\nI should explain both functions and recommend which one to use for their situation.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nYou're right, there are two main functions. Here's when to use each:\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION() - Use this one for comprehensive analysis:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('your_table', '(TRANSACTION_DATE)');\\n```\\n\\n**Returns detailed JSON with:**\\n- Clustering depth\\n- Overlap percentage  \\n- Total micro-partitions\\n- Clustered micro-partitions\\n- Average depth\\n- Notes and recommendations\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH() - Use for quick depth check:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('your_table', '(TRANSACTION_DATE)');\\n```\\n\\n**Returns only:**\\n- Simple clustering depth number (like your 96)\\n\\n**My recommendation: Use SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION()**\\n\\nFor your situation with the high clustering depth of 96, you want the full picture. The comprehensive function will show you:\\n- Current overlap percentage (you mentioned it was high)\\n- How many partitions are actually clustered\\n- Progress over time as automatic clustering works\\n- Specific recommendations from Snowflake\\n\\n**Example of what you'll see:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"cluster_by_keys\\\": \\\"(TRANSACTION_DATE)\\\",\\n  \\\"total_partition_count\\\": 15000,\\n  \\\"total_constant_partition_count\\\": 1200,\\n  \\\"average_overlaps\\\": 85.2,\\n  \\\"average_depth\\\": 96.0,\\n  \\\"partition_depth_histogram\\\": {...}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nUse the comprehensive function to monitor your clustering progress as the automatic process works to reduce that depth from 96 to a more reasonable number.\\n</answer>\",\"User: What's the differnce between these?\\n\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED', '(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)');\\n\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED');\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about the difference between two specific clustering functions they're running on their PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED table. I notice a few important differences in their examples:\\n\\n1. SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION() - they're specifying specific clustering keys (PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)\\n2. SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH() - they're not specifying any clustering keys\\n\\nThis is important because earlier they mentioned they were considering clustering on TRANSACTION_DATE only due to the high cardinality of ACCOUNT_ID, but now I see they're checking clustering information for both columns together.\\n\\nI should explain the differences between these functions and also point out the implications of their clustering key choices.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nHere are the key differences between those two functions:\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED', '(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)'):**\\n- **Detailed analysis** of clustering for the specific keys you specify\\n- Returns comprehensive JSON with metrics like overlap, depth, partition counts\\n- **Analyzes the compound clustering key** (both PLAIDACCOUNTID and TRANSACTIONDATE together)\\n- Shows how well data is clustered based on those specific columns\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED'):**\\n- **Simple numeric result** - just the clustering depth\\n- **Uses the table's actual defined clustering keys** (whatever was set with ALTER TABLE CLUSTER BY)\\n- No column specification needed - reads from table metadata\\n- Quick check of current clustering effectiveness\\n\\n**Important observation:**\\nI notice you're checking clustering info for **(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)** together, but earlier you were considering clustering on TRANSACTIONDATE only due to PLAIDACCOUNTID's high cardinality (7.4M values).\\n\\n**Questions to consider:**\\n- Did you end up clustering on both columns?\\n- If so, that compound key might be why your clustering depth is 96\\n- The high cardinality PLAIDACCOUNTID could be fragmenting your clustering\\n\\n**To check what clustering keys are actually defined:**\\n```sql\\nSHOW TABLES LIKE 'PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED';\\n-- Look at the CLUSTERING_KEY column\\n```\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\nCompare the clustering information for just TRANSACTIONDATE vs. the compound key to see which performs better:\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED', '(TRANSACTIONDATE)');\\n```</answer>\",\"User: Yes im clustered on by in order (date, id) my depth now has gone down to 18\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is providing an update on their clustering situation. They've confirmed they are clustering on both columns in the order (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID), and their clustering depth has improved significantly from 96 down to 18. This is actually a good result and shows that the automatic clustering process is working.\\n\\nI should acknowledge this improvement and provide context on what this means for their performance, while also noting that the compound clustering key is actually working better than I initially expected given the high cardinality of the ID column.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nThat's excellent progress! Your clustering depth dropping from 96 to 18 is a **significant improvement** and shows the automatic clustering is working well.\\n\\n**What this means:**\\n- **Depth of 18 is good** for a 1TB table with compound clustering keys\\n- You're now in the \\\"acceptable to good\\\" range (10-50)\\n- Query performance should be noticeably better\\n- Partition pruning is much more effective\\n\\n**Why the compound key (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID) is working:**\\n- **Date as the first key** provides the primary organization (smart choice)\\n- **ID as secondary** helps with account-specific queries without fragmenting too much\\n- The order matters - date first gives you the time-based benefits\\n\\n**Expected benefits you should see:**\\n- Date range queries: Much faster scanning\\n- Account-specific queries: Better partition pruning\\n- Combined date + account filters: Excellent performance\\n- Overall query costs: Reduced due to less data scanning\\n\\n**Monitoring going forward:**\\n- Depth might continue to improve slightly (target: 10-15 for optimal)\\n- Check overlap percentage - should also be decreasing\\n- Monitor query performance improvements\\n\\n**Bottom line:** Your clustering strategy is working well! The combination of low-cardinality date first, followed by high-cardinality ID, is proving effective for your data distribution. The automatic clustering process should continue to optimize this further, but you're already seeing the major benefits.\\n\\nGreat job on the clustering key selection and patience with the process!\\n</answer>\",\"User: does clustering change the size of Micropartiioons or just the order?\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about what clustering actually does to micro-partitions - whether it changes their size or just reorders them. This is a good technical question about how Snowflake's clustering mechanism works at the storage level.\\n\\nI need to explain:\\n1. What clustering does to micro-partitions\\n2. Whether it changes size vs. just reorganizing\\n3. How the physical storage is affected\\n4. The relationship between clustering and micro-partition structure\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nClustering **reorganizes and can change the composition** of micro-partitions, not just their order. Here's what actually happens:\\n\\n**What clustering does:**\\n\\n**1. Reorganizes data physically:**\\n- Moves rows with similar clustering key values into the same micro-partitions\\n- Can **split and merge micro-partitions** to achieve better clustering\\n- Creates new micro-partitions with better data locality\\n\\n**2. Micro-partition size effects:**\\n- **Size range stays the same** (50-500MB compressed, typically ~16MB)\\n- **Contents change** - similar clustering key values get grouped together\\n- May create new micro-partitions and mark old ones for deletion\\n\\n**3. Physical changes:**\\n- **Not just reordering** - actual data reorganization\\n- Rows get physically moved between micro-partitions\\n- Better compression often results from grouping similar data\\n\\n**Example of what happens:**\\n```\\nBefore clustering:\\nPartition 1: Dates [2023-01-01, 2023-06-15, 2023-12-31] + various accounts\\nPartition 2: Dates [2023-01-03, 2023-07-20, 2023-11-15] + various accounts\\n\\nAfter clustering:\\nPartition 1: Dates [2023-01-01, 2023-01-02, 2023-01-03] + related accounts  \\nPartition 2: Dates [2023-06-15, 2023-06-20, 2023-06-25] + related accounts\\n```\\n\\n**Storage implications:**\\n- **Storage usage may temporarily increase** during clustering (old + new partitions)\\n- **Better compression** often results from grouping similar values\\n- **Metadata updates** to track new partition boundaries\\n\\n**Performance benefits come from:**\\n- **Partition pruning** - skip irrelevant micro-partitions entirely\\n- **Better compression** - similar data compresses better\\n- **Reduced I/O** - related data stored together\\n\\nSo clustering is much more than reordering - it's a complete physical reorganization of how your data is stored in micro-partitions.\\n</answer>\",\"User: how can i set use chaced result to false\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking how to disable cached results in Snowflake. This is about the USE_CACHED_RESULT parameter/setting in Snowflake, which controls whether queries can use previously cached query results.\\n\\nThis is a straightforward technical question about Snowflake session parameters.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nYou can disable cached results in several ways depending on your scope:\\n\\n**1. For your current session:**\\n```sql\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n```\\n\\n**2. For a specific query:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT /*+ NO_CACHE */ * FROM your_table;\\n-- OR use the parameter in the query\\nSELECT * FROM your_table;\\n-- Run with USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE set for session\\n```\\n\\n**3. For your user account (persists across sessions):**\\n```sql\\nALTER USER your_username SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n```\\n\\n**4. At the warehouse level:**\\n```sql\\nALTER WAREHOUSE your_warehouse SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n```\\n\\n**5. Check current setting:**\\n```sql\\nSHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'USE_CACHED_RESULT';\\n```\\n\\n**Most common approach:**\\n```sql\\n-- Disable for current session\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n\\n-- Run your queries...\\n\\n-- Re-enable when done (optional)\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;\\n```\\n\\n**Why you might want to disable caching:**\\n- Testing actual query performance (not cached performance)\\n- Ensuring fresh data retrieval\\n- Benchmarking clustering improvements\\n- Development/testing scenarios\\n\\n**Note:** Disabling cached results will increase query costs and execution time since Snowflake won't use previously computed results, but it gives you true performance metrics for your clustering optimization testing.\\n</answer>\",\"User: show me syntax for a query\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking for syntax for a query, but they haven't specified what kind of query they want to see.

Best practices for their specific use case (1TB table with date and account ID)\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nSearch Optimization and clustering are **complementary** - you can and often should use both together! They optimize for different query patterns.\\n\\n**How they work together:**\\n\\n**Clustering optimizes for:**\\n- Range queries (date ranges, numeric ranges)\\n- Equality filters on clustered columns\\n- Time-series analysis\\n- Partition pruning at the micro-partition level\\n\\n**Search Optimization optimizes for:**\\n- Point lookups (exact value searches)\\n- Substring searches\\n- High-cardinality equality filters\\n- Queries that don't benefit much from clustering\\n\\n**For your PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED table:**\\n\\n**Use clustering for:**\\n```sql\\n-- These benefit from your (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID) clustering\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31';\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15' AND PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'account123';\\n```\\n\\n**Add search optimization for:**\\n```sql\\n-- Enable search optimization\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;\\n\\n-- These would benefit from search optimization\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE DESCRIPTION ILIKE '%coffee%';\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE MERCHANT_NAME = 'Starbucks';\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTION_ID = 'specific_id';\\n```\\n\\n**Best practice - use both:**\\n```sql\\n-- Your existing clustering (keep this)\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n\\n-- Add search optimization\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;\\n```\\n\\n**Cost considerations:**\\n- Clustering: Automatic maintenance cost\\n- Search optimization: Additional storage cost (~20-100% increase)\\n- Both provide query performance benefits that often offset costs\\n\\n**Bottom line:** Keep your clustering for date/account queries, and add search optimization for text searches and point lookups on other columns. They work together beautifully!\\n</answer>\",\"User: does it make sense to add search optimization on top of the clustering columns?\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThis is a great question about whether to add search optimization on columns that are already clustered.

Whether search optimization provides additional benefits on clustered columns\\n2. The cost/benefit analysis\\n3. What types of queries would benefit\\n4. Snowflake's recommendations on this\\n5. The specific characteristics of their columns (date with 2,700 values, account ID with 7.4M values)\\n</thinking> <answer>\\n**Generally no** - adding search optimization on top of clustering columns usually doesn't make sense. Here's why:\\n\\n**For your clustering columns:**\\n\\n**TRANSACTIONDATE (2,700 unique values):**\\n- **Clustering already handles this well** for range queries and equality\\n- Search optimization would provide minimal additional benefit\\n- **Not worth the cost** - clustering gives you excellent partition pruning\\n\\n**PLAIDACCOUNTID (7.4M unique values):**\\n- **This might be an exception** - high cardinality can benefit from search optimization\\n- Clustering helps when combined with date, but search optimization could help for account-only queries\\n- **Consider it** if you frequently query by account ID alone\\n\\n**Better approach - optimize non-clustered columns:**\\n```sql\\n-- Keep your existing clustering\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n\\n-- Add search optimization for OTHER columns that aren't clustered\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION \\nON (DESCRIPTION, MERCHANT_NAME, CATEGORY, TRANSACTION_ID);\\n```\\n\\n**Cost/benefit analysis:**\\n- **Clustering columns**: Already optimized, search optimization = redundant cost\\n- **Non-clustered columns**: No optimization, search optimization = high value\\n\\n**Exception case:**\\nIf you frequently run queries like:\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'specific_account';  -- No date filter\\n```\\n\\nThen search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID might help, but test the performance improvement vs. cost.\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Skip search optimization on TRANSACTIONDATE, maybe consider it for PLAIDACCOUNTID if you have account-only queries, but definitely add it to other frequently-queried columns that aren't clustered.\\n</answer>\",\"User: What does Percentage scanned from cache mean? I received a high number but i thought i turned off the cahce with that parameter\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about \\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" and they're confused because they thought they turned off caching with the USE_CACHED_RESULT parameter. This is a good question because there are different types of caching in Snowflake, and the USE_CACHED_RESULT parameter only affects one type.\\n\\nI need to explain:\\n1. The different types of caching in Snowflake\\n2. What \\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" specifically refers to\\n3. Why they're still seeing cache usage despite setting USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE\\n4. The difference between result caching and data caching\\n</thinking> <answer>\\n\\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" refers to **data cache** (warehouse cache), not **result cache** - these are different types of caching in Snowflake!\\n\\n**Two different cache types:**\\n\\n**1. Result Cache (what you disabled):**\\n- `USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE` disables this\\n- Stores complete query results for 24 hours\\n- Avoids re-running identical queries entirely\\n\\n**2. Data Cache/Warehouse Cache (still active):**\\n- **Cannot be disabled** - this is what \\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" measures\\n- Stores raw data in SSD cache on warehouse nodes\\n- Speeds up data retrieval from storage\\n- **This is good!** - you want high cache hit rates here\\n\\n**What you're seeing:**\\n```\\nPercentage scanned from cache: 85% (example)\\n```\\nThis means:\\n- 85% of data was read from fast SSD cache on warehouse\\n- 15% had to be fetched from slower remote storage\\n- **This is excellent performance** - high cache hit rate\\n\\n**Why this happens even with USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE:**\\n- Your query still runs (no result cache used)\\n- But data needed for the query comes from warehouse cache\\n- Especially common if you're running similar queries or accessing same date ranges\\n\\n**What you disabled vs. what's still working:**\\n- ❌ **Result cache**: Query won't reuse previous identical results\\n- ✅ **Data cache**: Data blocks still cached in warehouse for faster access\\n\\n**Bottom line:** High \\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" is **good news** - it means your warehouse is efficiently caching frequently accessed data, making your clustering performance tests faster and more realistic for typical usage patterns.\\n</answer>\",\"User: So should I add search optimization or not on PLAIDACCOUNTID?

Current clustering depth is 7 (which is excellent!)\\n3. Their query pattern is very specific: SELECT * WHERE ACCOUNTID = X AND TRANSACTION_DATE is last 100 days\\n\\nThis is actually a perfect use case for their current clustering strategy. The query pattern they described should work very well with their existing clustering on (DATE, ID) because:\\n- They're filtering on both clustered columns\\n- Date range + specific account ID is exactly what compound clustering optimizes for\\n- Clustering depth of 7 is excellent\\n\\nGiven this specific query pattern, search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID would likely be redundant and not cost-effective.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\n**No, don't add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID** for your use case. Here's why:\\n\\n**Your query pattern is perfect for clustering:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM table \\nWHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'XXXXXXX' \\n  AND TRANSACTIONDATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 100;\\n```\\n\\n**Why clustering already handles this optimally:**\\n- **Clustering depth of 7 is excellent** (ideal range is 1-10)\\n- Your compound clustering `(TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID)` is **perfectly designed** for this query pattern\\n- Date range (last 100 days) + specific account ID = **maximum clustering benefit**\\n- Snowflake will prune partitions based on both date range AND account ID\\n\\n**Search optimization would be redundant because:**\\n- You're **always filtering by both clustered columns**\\n- Clustering already provides excellent partition pruning\\n- Search optimization cost wouldn't be justified\\n- Your depth of 7 shows clustering is working perfectly\\n\\n**Cost/benefit analysis:**\\n- **Current clustering**: Handles your queries optimally (depth = 7)\\n- **Adding search optimization**: Extra storage cost (~20-100%) for minimal/no benefit\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\n```sql\\n-- Keep your existing clustering (it's working great!)\\n-- DON'T add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID\\n\\n-- Only consider search optimization for other columns if you query them:\\n-- ALTER TABLE ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (DESCRIPTION, MERCHANT_NAME);\\n```\\n\\n**Your clustering strategy is spot-on** for your query patterns.

Given their query pattern (SELECT * WHERE ACCOUNTID = X AND TRANSACTIONDATE in last 100 days) and their current clustering setup with depth 7, I need to think about what additional optimizations could help achieve the lowest possible latency.\\n\\nFor low latency, they should consider:\\n1. Their current clustering is already very good (depth 7)\\n2. Search optimization might actually help for the PLAIDACCOUNTID lookups even though it's clustered\\n3. Other optimizations like warehouse size, result caching (when appropriate), materialized views\\n4. The specific nature of their query pattern\\n\\nGiven that they need LOW LATENCY specifically, the cost/benefit calculation changes. Even small improvements might be worth it.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nFor **low latency**, the calculation changes - you should **consider adding search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID**. Here's why:\\n\\n**Low latency optimization strategy:**\\n\\n**1. Keep your excellent clustering (depth 7 is great):**\\n```sql\\n-- Your current setup is already optimized\\nCLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID)\\n```\\n\\n**2. Add search optimization for the account lookup:**\\n```sql\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n```\\n\\n**Why this helps for low latency:**\\n- **Point lookup optimization**: Even with clustering, search optimization can make the account ID lookup faster\\n- **Micro-second improvements**: For low latency, every optimization counts\\n- **High cardinality benefit**: 6.7M unique values can benefit from search optimization's indexing\\n- **Compound benefit**: Clustering + search optimization working together\\n\\n**Additional low latency optimizations:**\\n\\n**3. Warehouse sizing:**\\n```sql\\n-- Use larger warehouse for lower latency\\nALTER WAREHOUSE your_warehouse SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE'; -- or XL\\n```\\n\\n**4. Consider materialized views for common patterns:**\\n```sql\\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW recent_transactions AS\\nSELECT * FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 100;\\n```\\n\\n**5. Enable result caching for repeated queries:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE; -- For production queries\\n```\\n\\n**Cost vs. latency trade-off:**\\n- Search optimization cost: ~20-100% storage increase\\n- Latency improvement: Potentially 10-50% faster account lookups\\n- **For low latency requirements**: Usually worth it\\n\\n**Bottom line:** Your clustering is excellent, but for true low latency, add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID.

It combines employee details from SFDC_WORKDAY_USER_WITH_REPORTING_CHAIN with hierarchical reporting relationships from REPORTING_CHAIN_FLAT, while PRODUCT_OWNERS adds product management structure information. The model enables analysis of reporting chains, team structures, and product ownership across different management levels, with multiple relationships between tables based on employee identifiers and names. This model is particularly useful for understanding organizational hierarchy, product ownership, and management chains within the company..

      "  snow.ai.observability.agent.thread_id.messages: [\"User: can i create a clone of a table and add lcustering keys?\",\"Assistant: \\nYes, you can create a clone of a table and add clustering keys in Snowflake. Here are the main approaches:\\n\\n**Method 1: Clone first, then add clustering keys**\\n1. Create a clone of the existing table:\\n   ```sql\\n   CREATE TABLE new_table CLONE existing_table;\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Add clustering keys to the cloned table:\\n   ```sql\\n   ALTER TABLE new_table CLUSTER BY (column1, column2);\\n   ```\\n\\n**Method 2: Create clone with clustering keys in one step**\\nYou can also create a new table with clustering keys using CREATE TABLE AS SELECT:\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE new_table \\nCLUSTER BY (column1, column2) \\nAS SELECT * FROM existing_table;\\n```\\n\\n**Key considerations:**\\n- Cloning preserves the data and structure but not necessarily the clustering keys from the original table\\n- You can add clustering keys to any table after creation using ALTER TABLE\\n- Clustering keys help optimize query performance by physically organizing data\\n- You can specify up to 4 columns as clustering keys\\n- The clustering process happens automatically in the background after you define the keys\\n\\n**Benefits of adding clustering keys:**\\n- Improved query performance for filtered queries\\n- Better data pruning during query execution\\n- Reduced scan times for large tables\\n\\nThe clone operation is very fast since it uses Snowflake's zero-copy cloning feature, and adding clustering keys afterward will help optimize the table for your specific query patterns.\\n\",\"User: is if i have a transactiondate as type string sohuld i make it a date?\",\"Assistant: \\nYes, you should definitely convert a transaction date from string to date type. Here's why:\\n\\n**Benefits of using DATE data type:**\\n\\n**Performance advantages:**\\n- Date operations are much faster than string operations\\n- Better query optimization and indexing\\n- More efficient storage (dates take less space than strings)\\n- Improved clustering and partitioning performance\\n\\n**Functionality benefits:**\\n- Built-in date functions (DATE_TRUNC, DATEADD, DATEDIFF, etc.)\\n- Proper date arithmetic and comparisons\\n- Time zone handling capabilities\\n- Automatic validation of date values\\n\\n**Query improvements:**\\n- Range queries perform better (WHERE date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31')\\n- Date formatting functions work properly\\n- Aggregations by time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly) are easier\\n\\n**How to convert:**\\n```sql\\n-- Add new date column\\nALTER TABLE your_table ADD COLUMN transaction_date_new DATE;\\n\\n-- Convert string to date\\nUPDATE your_table \\nSET transaction_date_new = TRY_TO_DATE(transaction_date_string, 'YYYY-MM-DD');\\n\\n-- Check for conversion errors\\nSELECT * FROM your_table WHERE transaction_date_new IS NULL;\\n\\n-- Drop old column and rename new one\\nALTER TABLE your_table DROP COLUMN transaction_date_string;\\nALTER TABLE your_table RENAME COLUMN transaction_date_new TO transaction_date;\\n```\\n\\n**Important considerations:**\\n- Use TRY_TO_DATE() to handle invalid date strings gracefully\\n- Verify the date format in your string data first\\n- Check for any NULL values after conversion\\n- Consider if you need DATE, TIMESTAMP, or TIMESTAMP_TZ based on your requirements\\n\\nConverting to proper date types is almost always worth the effort for better performance and functionality.\\n\",\"User: does clustering take time? i just ran a cluster by and i am seeing very high overlap\",\"Assistant: \\nYes, clustering does take time, and seeing high overlap immediately after adding clustering keys is completely normal. Here's what's happening:\\n\\n**Why clustering takes time:**\\n- Clustering is an **asynchronous background process** that Snowflake runs automatically\\n- It doesn't happen instantly when you run `ALTER TABLE ... CLUSTER BY`\\n- The process reorganizes data physically based on your clustering keys\\n- Time depends on table size, data distribution, and system resources\\n\\n**What \\\"high overlap\\\" means:**\\n- Overlap measures how much data in different micro-partitions shares the same clustering key values\\n- **High overlap = poor clustering** (data is scattered across many micro-partitions)\\n- **Low overlap = good clustering** (similar values are grouped together)\\n- Right after adding clustering keys, overlap will be high because data hasn't been reorganized yet\\n\\n**What to expect:**\\n```sql\\n-- Check clustering information\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('your_table', '(column1, column2)');\\n\\n-- Monitor clustering depth and overlap over time\\nSHOW TABLES LIKE 'your_table';\\n-- Look at CLUSTERING_KEY and other clustering metrics\\n```\\n\\n**Timeline expectations:**\\n- Small tables (< 1GB): Minutes to hours\\n- Medium tables (1-100GB): Hours to days  \\n- Large tables (> 100GB): Days to weeks\\n- Process runs during low-activity periods to minimize impact\\n\\n**Best practices:**\\n- Be patient - let the automatic clustering process work\\n- Monitor progress with `SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION()`\\n- Don't re-cluster manually unless absolutely necessary\\n- Choose clustering keys wisely (commonly filtered columns)\\n\\nThe high overlap you're seeing should decrease over time as Snowflake's automatic clustering service reorganizes your data in the background.\\n\",\"User: Quesiton for you. This table is massive 1TB. TRANSACTION_DATE has cardinatlit of 2700 unique vlaues. ACCOUNT_ID has very high cardinality of 7.4 million unique values. Does it make sense to add a clustering key on both columns or only one?\",\"Assistant: \\nFor a 1TB table with those cardinality characteristics, I'd recommend **clustering on TRANSACTION_DATE only**, not both columns. Here's why:\\n\\n**Why TRANSACTION_DATE alone is better:**\\n\\n**Cardinality considerations:**\\n- 2,700 unique dates is ideal for clustering (good selectivity without being too granular)\\n- 7.4M unique ACCOUNT_IDs is extremely high cardinality - poor for clustering\\n- High cardinality clustering keys often provide minimal benefit and can hurt performance\\n\\n**Query pattern benefits:**\\n- Most analytical queries filter by date ranges (monthly/quarterly reports, time-based analysis)\\n- Date-based clustering enables excellent partition pruning\\n- Time-series data naturally benefits from chronological organization\\n\\n**Why not both columns:**\\n- **Compound clustering keys become less effective** with high cardinality columns\\n- ACCOUNT_ID's 7.4M values would create too much fragmentation\\n- The clustering maintenance overhead increases significantly\\n- Diminishing returns on query performance improvement\\n\\n**Recommended approach:**\\n```sql\\nALTER TABLE your_table CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTION_DATE);\\n```\\n\\n**Alternative considerations:**\\n- If you frequently query specific account ranges, consider **partitioning strategies** instead\\n- For account-specific queries, proper indexing or materialized views might be better\\n- Consider if ACCOUNT_ID has any patterns (geographic, categorical) that could be clustered instead\\n\\n**Expected benefits with date clustering:**\\n- Dramatic improvement for date range queries\\n- Better compression due to similar dates being stored together\\n- Faster aggregations by time periods\\n- Reduced scanning for time-based analytics\\n\\nThe 1TB size makes clustering even more valuable, but stick with the low-cardinality date column for maximum effectiveness.\\n\",\"User: my clustering depth on my table is 96\",\"Assistant: \\nA clustering depth of 96 is **very high** and indicates poor clustering. Here's what this means and what you should do:\\n\\n**What clustering depth means:**\\n- Clustering depth = average number of micro-partitions that must be scanned to find all rows for a clustering key value\\n- **Ideal range: 1-10** (excellent clustering)\\n- **Acceptable range: 10-50** (decent clustering)\\n- **Your depth of 96 = poor clustering** (data is very scattered)\\n\\n**Why your depth is so high:**\\n- Data is spread across many micro-partitions instead of being grouped together\\n- For your 1TB table, this means inefficient scanning\\n- Could be due to:\\n  - Recent large data loads without clustering maintenance\\n  - Poor clustering key choice (though TRANSACTION_DATE should be good)\\n  - Data insertion patterns that scatter dates across partitions\\n\\n**Immediate actions:**\\n\\n**1. Check current clustering status:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('your_table', '(TRANSACTION_DATE)');\\n```\\n\\n**2. Consider manual re-clustering (carefully):**\\n```sql\\n-- Only if absolutely necessary and during low-usage periods\\nALTER TABLE your_table RECLUSTER;\\n```\\n\\n**3. Monitor the automatic clustering:**\\n- Snowflake's automatic clustering should gradually improve this\\n- With 1TB, it may take days/weeks to fully optimize\\n- Check progress daily with the clustering information function\\n\\n**Expected improvements:**\\n- Target depth should eventually reach 10-30 for your table size\\n- Query performance will improve significantly as depth decreases\\n- Partition pruning will become much more effective\\n\\n**Warning:** Manual reclustering on a 1TB table will be expensive and time-consuming. Let automatic clustering work first, and only manually recluster if it's not improving after a reasonable time period.\",\"User: which function should i use to check? i see there's two\",\"Assistant: \\nYou're right, there are two main functions. Here's when to use each:\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION() - Use this one for comprehensive analysis:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('your_table', '(TRANSACTION_DATE)');\\n```\\n\\n**Returns detailed JSON with:**\\n- Clustering depth\\n- Overlap percentage  \\n- Total micro-partitions\\n- Clustered micro-partitions\\n- Average depth\\n- Notes and recommendations\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH() - Use for quick depth check:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('your_table', '(TRANSACTION_DATE)');\\n```\\n\\n**Returns only:**\\n- Simple clustering depth number (like your 96)\\n\\n**My recommendation: Use SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION()**\\n\\nFor your situation with the high clustering depth of 96, you want the full picture. The comprehensive function will show you:\\n- Current overlap percentage (you mentioned it was high)\\n- How many partitions are actually clustered\\n- Progress over time as automatic clustering works\\n- Specific recommendations from Snowflake\\n\\n**Example of what you'll see:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"cluster_by_keys\\\": \\\"(TRANSACTION_DATE)\\\",\\n  \\\"total_partition_count\\\": 15000,\\n  \\\"total_constant_partition_count\\\": 1200,\\n  \\\"average_overlaps\\\": 85.2,\\n  \\\"average_depth\\\": 96.0,\\n  \\\"partition_depth_histogram\\\": {...}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nUse the comprehensive function to monitor your clustering progress as the automatic process works to reduce that depth from 96 to a more reasonable number.\\n\",\"User: What's the differnce between these?\\n\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED', '(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)');\\n\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED');\",\"Assistant: \\nHere are the key differences between those two functions:\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED', '(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)'):**\\n- **Detailed analysis** of clustering for the specific keys you specify\\n- Returns comprehensive JSON with metrics like overlap, depth, partition counts\\n- **Analyzes the compound clustering key** (both PLAIDACCOUNTID and TRANSACTIONDATE together)\\n- Shows how well data is clustered based on those specific columns\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED'):**\\n- **Simple numeric result** - just the clustering depth\\n- **Uses the table's actual defined clustering keys** (whatever was set with ALTER TABLE CLUSTER BY)\\n- No column specification needed - reads from table metadata\\n- Quick check of current clustering effectiveness\\n\\n**Important observation:**\\nI notice you're checking clustering info for **(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)** together, but earlier you were considering clustering on TRANSACTIONDATE only due to PLAIDACCOUNTID's high cardinality (7.4M values).\\n\\n**Questions to consider:**\\n- Did you end up clustering on both columns?\\n- If so, that compound key might be why your clustering depth is 96\\n- The high cardinality PLAIDACCOUNTID could be fragmenting your clustering\\n\\n**To check what clustering keys are actually defined:**\\n```sql\\nSHOW TABLES LIKE 'PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED';\\n-- Look at the CLUSTERING_KEY column\\n```\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\nCompare the clustering information for just TRANSACTIONDATE vs. the compound key to see which performs better:\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED', '(TRANSACTIONDATE)');\\n```\",\"User: Yes im clustered on by in order (date, id) my depth now has gone down to 18\",\"Assistant: \\nThat's excellent progress! Your clustering depth dropping from 96 to 18 is a **significant improvement** and shows the automatic clustering is working well.\\n\\n**What this means:**\\n- **Depth of 18 is good** for a 1TB table with compound clustering keys\\n- You're now in the \\\"acceptable to good\\\" range (10-50)\\n- Query performance should be noticeably better\\n- Partition pruning is much more effective\\n\\n**Why the compound key (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID) is working:**\\n- **Date as the first key** provides the primary organization (smart choice)\\n- **ID as secondary** helps with account-specific queries without fragmenting too much\\n- The order matters - date first gives you the time-based benefits\\n\\n**Expected benefits you should see:**\\n- Date range queries: Much faster scanning\\n- Account-specific queries: Better partition pruning\\n- Combined date + account filters: Excellent performance\\n- Overall query costs: Reduced due to less data scanning\\n\\n**Monitoring going forward:**\\n- Depth might continue to improve slightly (target: 10-15 for optimal)\\n- Check overlap percentage - should also be decreasing\\n- Monitor query performance improvements\\n\\n**Bottom line:** Your clustering strategy is working well! The combination of low-cardinality date first, followed by high-cardinality ID, is proving effective for your data distribution. The automatic clustering process should continue to optimize this further, but you're already seeing the major benefits.\\n\\nGreat job on the clustering key selection and patience with the process!\\n\",\"User: does clustering change the size of Micropartiioons or just the order?\",\"Assistant: \\nClustering **reorganizes and can change the composition** of micro-partitions, not just their order. Here's what actually happens:\\n\\n**What clustering does:**\\n\\n**1. Reorganizes data physically:**\\n- Moves rows with similar clustering key values into the same micro-partitions\\n- Can **split and merge micro-partitions** to achieve better clustering\\n- Creates new micro-partitions with better data locality\\n\\n**2. Micro-partition size effects:**\\n- **Size range stays the same** (50-500MB compressed, typically ~16MB)\\n- **Contents change** - similar clustering key values get grouped together\\n- May create new micro-partitions and mark old ones for deletion\\n\\n**3. Physical changes:**\\n- **Not just reordering** - actual data reorganization\\n- Rows get physically moved between micro-partitions\\n- Better compression often results from grouping similar data\\n\\n**Example of what happens:**\\n```\\nBefore clustering:\\nPartition 1: Dates [2023-01-01, 2023-06-15, 2023-12-31] + various accounts\\nPartition 2: Dates [2023-01-03, 2023-07-20, 2023-11-15] + various accounts\\n\\nAfter clustering:\\nPartition 1: Dates [2023-01-01, 2023-01-02, 2023-01-03] + related accounts  \\nPartition 2: Dates [2023-06-15, 2023-06-20, 2023-06-25] + related accounts\\n```\\n\\n**Storage implications:**\\n- **Storage usage may temporarily increase** during clustering (old + new partitions)\\n- **Better compression** often results from grouping similar values\\n- **Metadata updates** to track new partition boundaries\\n\\n**Performance benefits come from:**\\n- **Partition pruning** - skip irrelevant micro-partitions entirely\\n- **Better compression** - similar data compresses better\\n- **Reduced I/O** - related data stored together\\n\\nSo clustering is much more than reordering - it's a complete physical reorganization of how your data is stored in micro-partitions.\\n\",\"User: how can i set use chaced result to false\",\"Assistant: \\nYou can disable cached results in several ways depending on your scope:\\n\\n**1. For your current session:**\\n```sql\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n```\\n\\n**2. For a specific query:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT /*+ NO_CACHE */ * FROM your_table;\\n-- OR use the parameter in the query\\nSELECT * FROM your_table;\\n-- Run with USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE set for session\\n```\\n\\n**3. For your user account (persists across sessions):**\\n```sql\\nALTER USER your_username SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n```\\n\\n**4. At the warehouse level:**\\n```sql\\nALTER WAREHOUSE your_warehouse SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n```\\n\\n**5. Check current setting:**\\n```sql\\nSHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'USE_CACHED_RESULT';\\n```\\n\\n**Most common approach:**\\n```sql\\n-- Disable for current session\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n\\n-- Run your queries...\\n\\n-- Re-enable when done (optional)\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;\\n```\\n\\n**Why you might want to disable caching:**\\n- Testing actual query performance (not cached performance)\\n- Ensuring fresh data retrieval\\n- Benchmarking clustering improvements\\n- Development/testing scenarios\\n\\n**Note:** Disabling cached results will increase query costs and execution time since Snowflake won't use previously computed results, but it gives you true performance metrics for your clustering optimization testing.\\n\",\"User: show me syntax for a query\",\"Assistant: \\nI'd be happy to show you query syntax! Could you clarify what type of query you're looking for? Here are some common examples based on our clustering discussion:\\n\\n**1. Test clustering performance (date range query):**\\n```sql\\nSELECT COUNT(*), \\n       MIN(TRANSACTIONDATE), \\n       MAX(TRANSACTIONDATE),\\n       COUNT(DISTINCT PLAIDACCOUNTID)\\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31';\\n```\\n\\n**2. Account-specific query:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT TRANSACTIONDATE, \\n       AMOUNT, \\n       DESCRIPTION\\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'specific_account_id'\\n  AND TRANSACTIONDATE >= '2023-01-01'\\nORDER BY TRANSACTIONDATE DESC;\\n```\\n\\n**3. Aggregation by date:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TRANSACTIONDATE) as month,\\n       COUNT(*) as transaction_count,\\n       SUM(AMOUNT) as total_amount\\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE >= '2023-01-01'\\nGROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', TRANSACTIONDATE)\\nORDER BY month;\\n```\\n\\n**4. Basic table exploration:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT * \\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nLIMIT 100;\\n```\\n\\nWhich type of query syntax were you looking for, or did you have something specific in mind?\\n\",\"User: no sorry using ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE; in a query\",\"Assistant: \\nHere's the syntax for using `ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE` with queries:\\n\\n**Option 1: Set session parameter, then run query:**\\n```sql\\n-- Disable cached results for the session\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n\\n-- Then run your query\\nSELECT COUNT(*), \\n       MIN(TRANSACTIONDATE), \\n       MAX(TRANSACTIONDATE)\\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31';\\n```\\n\\n**Option 2: Multiple statements in sequence:**\\n```sql\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n\\nSELECT * FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'some_account_id' \\n  AND TRANSACTIONDATE >= '2023-01-01'\\nLIMIT 1000;\\n\\n-- Re-enable caching when done (optional)\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;\\n```\\n\\n**Option 3: In a script/batch:**\\n```sql\\n-- Disable caching\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n\\n-- Test clustering performance\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED', '(TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID)');\\n\\n-- Run performance test query\\nSELECT COUNT(*) \\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15';\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** The `ALTER SESSION` command affects the entire session, so all subsequent queries in that session will not use cached results until you change it back or start a new session.\\n\",\"User: ignore alter session i want SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE used within a query\",\"Assistant: \\nYou cannot use `SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE` directly **within** a SELECT query, but here are the ways to disable caching for a specific query:\\n\\n**Option 1: SET statement before query (single execution):**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15';\\n```\\n\\n**Option 2: Using query hint (if supported):**\\n```sql\\nSELECT /*+ NO_CACHE */ COUNT(*) \\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15';\\n```\\n\\n**Option 3: Multi-statement execution:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\nSELECT * FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED LIMIT 10;\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;\\n```\\n\\n**What WON'T work:**\\n```sql\\n-- This is invalid syntax\\nSELECT COUNT(*), SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE \\nFROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED;\\n```\\n\\nThe `SET` command must be executed as a separate statement before your query runs. Snowflake doesn't allow parameter setting within the SELECT statement itself.\\n\\n**Most practical approach:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n-- Your query here\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';\\n```\",\"User: will this work in a worksheet?\",\"Assistant: \\nYes, it will work in a Snowflake worksheet! Here's how:\\n\\n**In a Snowflake worksheet, you can run:**\\n\\n**Option 1: Select and run both statements together:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15';\\n```\\n- Highlight both lines and click \\\"Run\\\"\\n- Or put cursor anywhere and run all statements\\n\\n**Option 2: Run statements separately:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n```\\nRun this first, then run:\\n```sql\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15';\\n```\\n\\n**Important worksheet behavior:**\\n- The `SET` command affects your **entire worksheet session**\\n- Once set to FALSE, all subsequent queries in that worksheet won't use cache\\n- Persists until you close the worksheet or set it back to TRUE\\n- Each worksheet has its own session scope\\n\\n**To reset caching in the same worksheet:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;\\n```\\n\\n**Pro tip for testing:**\\n```sql\\n-- Disable caching\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n\\n-- Test your clustering performance\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31';\\n\\n-- Re-enable caching when done\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;\\n```\\n\\nThis is perfect for testing your clustering improvements without cached results interfering!\\n\",\"User: is search optimization and clustering complementary or should i only use one or the other?\",\"Assistant: \\nSearch Optimization and clustering are **complementary** - you can and often should use both together! They optimize for different query patterns.\\n\\n**How they work together:**\\n\\n**Clustering optimizes for:**\\n- Range queries (date ranges, numeric ranges)\\n- Equality filters on clustered columns\\n- Time-series analysis\\n- Partition pruning at the micro-partition level\\n\\n**Search Optimization optimizes for:**\\n- Point lookups (exact value searches)\\n- Substring searches\\n- High-cardinality equality filters\\n- Queries that don't benefit much from clustering\\n\\n**For your PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED table:**\\n\\n**Use clustering for:**\\n```sql\\n-- These benefit from your (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID) clustering\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31';\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15' AND PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'account123';\\n```\\n\\n**Add search optimization for:**\\n```sql\\n-- Enable search optimization\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;\\n\\n-- These would benefit from search optimization\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE DESCRIPTION ILIKE '%coffee%';\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE MERCHANT_NAME = 'Starbucks';\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTION_ID = 'specific_id';\\n```\\n\\n**Best practice - use both:**\\n```sql\\n-- Your existing clustering (keep this)\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n\\n-- Add search optimization\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;\\n```\\n\\n**Cost considerations:**\\n- Clustering: Automatic maintenance cost\\n- Search optimization: Additional storage cost (~20-100% increase)\\n- Both provide query performance benefits that often offset costs\\n\\n**Bottom line:** Keep your clustering for date/account queries, and add search optimization for text searches and point lookups on other columns. They work together beautifully!\\n\",\"User: does it make sense to add search optimization on top of the clustering columns?\",\"Assistant: \\n**Generally no** - adding search optimization on top of clustering columns usually doesn't make sense. Here's why:\\n\\n**For your clustering columns:**\\n\\n**TRANSACTIONDATE (2,700 unique values):**\\n- **Clustering already handles this well** for range queries and equality\\n- Search optimization would provide minimal additional benefit\\n- **Not worth the cost** - clustering gives you excellent partition pruning\\n\\n**PLAIDACCOUNTID (7.4M unique values):**\\n- **This might be an exception** - high cardinality can benefit from search optimization\\n- Clustering helps when combined with date, but search optimization could help for account-only queries\\n- **Consider it** if you frequently query by account ID alone\\n\\n**Better approach - optimize non-clustered columns:**\\n```sql\\n-- Keep your existing clustering\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n\\n-- Add search optimization for OTHER columns that aren't clustered\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION \\nON (DESCRIPTION, MERCHANT_NAME, CATEGORY, TRANSACTION_ID);\\n```\\n\\n**Cost/benefit analysis:**\\n- **Clustering columns**: Already optimized, search optimization = redundant cost\\n- **Non-clustered columns**: No optimization, search optimization = high value\\n\\n**Exception case:**\\nIf you frequently run queries like:\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'specific_account';  -- No date filter\\n```\\n\\nThen search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID might help, but test the performance improvement vs. cost.\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Skip search optimization on TRANSACTIONDATE, maybe consider it for PLAIDACCOUNTID if you have account-only queries, but definitely add it to other frequently-queried columns that aren't clustered.\\n\",\"User: What does Percentage scanned from cache mean? I received a high number but i thought i turned off the cahce with that parameter\",\"Assistant: \\n\\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" refers to **data cache** (warehouse cache), not **result cache** - these are different types of caching in Snowflake!\\n\\n**Two different cache types:**\\n\\n**1. Result Cache (what you disabled):**\\n- `USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE` disables this\\n- Stores complete query results for 24 hours\\n- Avoids re-running identical queries entirely\\n\\n**2. Data Cache/Warehouse Cache (still active):**\\n- **Cannot be disabled** - this is what \\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" measures\\n- Stores raw data in SSD cache on warehouse nodes\\n- Speeds up data retrieval from storage\\n- **This is good!** - you want high cache hit rates here\\n\\n**What you're seeing:**\\n```\\nPercentage scanned from cache: 85% (example)\\n```\\nThis means:\\n- 85% of data was read from fast SSD cache on warehouse\\n- 15% had to be fetched from slower remote storage\\n- **This is excellent performance** - high cache hit rate\\n\\n**Why this happens even with USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE:**\\n- Your query still runs (no result cache used)\\n- But data needed for the query comes from warehouse cache\\n- Especially common if you're running similar queries or accessing same date ranges\\n\\n**What you disabled vs. what's still working:**\\n- ❌ **Result cache**: Query won't reuse previous identical results\\n- ✅ **Data cache**: Data blocks still cached in warehouse for faster access\\n\\n**Bottom line:** High \\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" is **good news** - it means your warehouse is efficiently caching frequently accessed data, making your clustering performance tests faster and more realistic for typical usage patterns.\\n\",\"User: So should I add search optimization or not on PLAIDACCOUNTID? It has 6.7 unique values. Right now cluster depth is 7 for CLUSTER BY (DATE, ID). THe query patterns will only be select * from table where ACCOUNTID= XXXXXXX and TRANSACTION_DATE is last 100 days or so\",\"Assistant: \\n**No, don't add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID** for your use case. Here's why:\\n\\n**Your query pattern is perfect for clustering:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM table \\nWHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'XXXXXXX' \\n  AND TRANSACTIONDATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 100;\\n```\\n\\n**Why clustering already handles this optimally:**\\n- **Clustering depth of 7 is excellent** (ideal range is 1-10)\\n- Your compound clustering `(TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID)` is **perfectly designed** for this query pattern\\n- Date range (last 100 days) + specific account ID = **maximum clustering benefit**\\n- Snowflake will prune partitions based on both date range AND account ID\\n\\n**Search optimization would be redundant because:**\\n- You're **always filtering by both clustered columns**\\n- Clustering already provides excellent partition pruning\\n- Search optimization cost wouldn't be justified\\n- Your depth of 7 shows clustering is working perfectly\\n\\n**Cost/benefit analysis:**\\n- **Current clustering**: Handles your queries optimally (depth = 7)\\n- **Adding search optimization**: Extra storage cost (~20-100%) for minimal/no benefit\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\n```sql\\n-- Keep your existing clustering (it's working great!)\\n-- DON'T add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID\\n\\n-- Only consider search optimization for other columns if you query them:\\n-- ALTER TABLE ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (DESCRIPTION, MERCHANT_NAME);\\n```\\n\\n**Your clustering strategy is spot-on** for your query patterns. A depth of 7 with compound clustering for exactly the filters you use = perfect optimization. Don't fix what isn't broken!\\n\",\"User: I need to achieve low latency\",\"Assistant: \\nFor **low latency**, the calculation changes - you should **consider adding search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID**. Here's why:\\n\\n**Low latency optimization strategy:**\\n\\n**1. Keep your excellent clustering (depth 7 is great):**\\n```sql\\n-- Your current setup is already optimized\\nCLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID)\\n```\\n\\n**2. Add search optimization for the account lookup:**\\n```sql\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n```\\n\\n**Why this helps for low latency:**\\n- **Point lookup optimization**: Even with clustering, search optimization can make the account ID lookup faster\\n- **Micro-second improvements**: For low latency, every optimization counts\\n- **High cardinality benefit**: 6.7M unique values can benefit from search optimization's indexing\\n- **Compound benefit**: Clustering + search optimization working together\\n\\n**Additional low latency optimizations:**\\n\\n**3. Warehouse sizing:**\\n```sql\\n-- Use larger warehouse for lower latency\\nALTER WAREHOUSE your_warehouse SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE'; -- or XL\\n```\\n\\n**4. Consider materialized views for common patterns:**\\n```sql\\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW recent_transactions AS\\nSELECT * FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 100;\\n```\\n\\n**5. Enable result caching for repeated queries:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE; -- For production queries\\n```\\n\\n**Cost vs. latency trade-off:**\\n- Search optimization cost: ~20-100% storage increase\\n- Latency improvement: Potentially 10-50% faster account lookups\\n- **For low latency requirements**: Usually worth it\\n\\n**Bottom line:** Your clustering is excellent, but for true low latency, add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID. The combination of both optimizations will give you the fastest possible performance for your query pattern.\\n\",\"User: I want to create a copy of my table and then add search optimization to compare the differences. How could i do this?\",\"Assistant: \\nGreat approach for A/B testing! Here's how to create a copy and compare performance:\\n\\n**Step 1: Create a clone of your table**\\n```sql\\n-- Clone preserves data, structure, and clustering keys\\nCREATE TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST \\nCLONE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED;\\n```\\n\\n**Step 2: Add search optimization to the clone**\\n```sql\\n-- Add search optimization to the test table\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST \\nADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n```\\n\\n**Step 3: Wait for search optimization to build**\\n```sql\\n-- Check search optimization status\\nSELECT SYSTEM$GET_SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_STATUS('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST');\\n-- Wait until it shows \\\"ENABLED\\\" and build is complete\\n```\\n\\n**Step 4: Performance comparison queries**\\n```sql\\n-- Disable result caching for accurate comparison\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n\\n-- Test original table (clustering only)\\nSELECT * FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'test_account_id' \\n  AND TRANSACTIONDATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 100;\\n\\n-- Test clone with search optimization (clustering + search opt)\\nSELECT * FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST \\nWHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'test_account_id' \\n  AND TRANSACTIONDATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 100;\\n```\\n\\n**Step 5: Compare metrics**\\nLook at query profile for both queries:\\n- Execution time\\n- Data scanned\\n- Partitions scanned\\n- Bytes scanned\\n\\n**Step 6: Clean up when done**\\n```sql\\n-- Drop test table after comparison\\nDROP TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST;\\n```\\n\\n**Pro tip:** Run multiple test queries with different account IDs to get average performance improvements!\\n\",\"User: Will my clone have the same clustering?\",\"Assistant: \\n**Yes, your clone will have the same clustering keys**, but there are some important details:\\n\\n**What gets preserved in the clone:**\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST \\nCLONE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED;\\n```\\n\\n✅ **Clustering key definition**: `CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID)`  \\n✅ **Data and structure**: Exact copy of all rows  \\n✅ **Physical clustering state**: The actual clustering depth and organization  \\n\\n**Verify clustering was preserved:**\\n```sql\\n-- Check clustering keys are the same\\nSHOW TABLES LIKE 'PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED%';\\n-- Look at CLUSTERING_KEY column for both tables\\n\\n-- Check clustering depth is the same\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED');\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST');\\n```\\n\\n**What this means for your test:**\\n- **Perfect A/B test setup**: Both tables have identical clustering (depth ~7)\\n- **Only difference**: Search optimization on the clone\\n- **Fair comparison**: Any performance difference is purely from search optimization\\n\\n**Expected results:**\\n```sql\\n-- Both should show same clustering depth\\nOriginal table clustering depth: 7\\nClone table clustering depth: 7\\n\\n-- Both should have same clustering keys\\nCLUSTERING_KEY: (TRANSACTIONDATE,PLAIDACCOUNTID)\\n```\\n\\n**Bottom line:** Your clone is a perfect copy with identical clustering, making it ideal for testing whether search optimization provides additional benefits on top of your already well-clustered table.\\n\",\"User: how do i add the search optimization path on plaidaccountid\",\"Assistant: \\nHere's the exact syntax to add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID:\\n\\n```sql\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST \\nADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n```\\n\\n**To check if it was added successfully:**\\n```sql\\n-- Check search optimization status\\nSHOW TABLES LIKE 'PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST';\\n-- Look for SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION column\\n\\n-- Or check detailed status\\nSELECT SYSTEM$GET_SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_STATUS('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST');\\n```\\n\\n**Monitor the build progress:**\\n```sql\\n-- This will show build status and progress\\nSELECT SYSTEM$GET_SEARCH_OPTIMIZATION_STATUS('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST');\\n\\n-- Status will show something like:\\n-- \\\"BUILDING\\\" -> \\\"ENABLED\\\" when complete\\n```\\n\\n**If you want to add multiple columns:**\\n```sql\\n-- Multiple columns syntax\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED_SEARCH_TEST \\nADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (PLAIDACCOUNTID, DESCRIPTION, MERCHANT_NAME);\\n```\\n\\n**Note:** The search optimization build process will take time (potentially hours for a 1TB table), so be patient before running your performance comparison tests.

This appears to be a technical question about Snowflake database functionality, specifically about table cloning and clustering keys. \\n\\nThis is not a question that requires querying data from the available semantic models (Workday_Orgchart) or searching through documents. This is more of a \\\"how-to\\\" or system capability question about Snowflake features.\\n\\nSince this is asking about system capabilities and Snowflake functionality, I should answer based on my knowledge of Snowflake's features regarding table cloning and clustering keys.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nYes, you can create a clone of a table and add clustering keys in Snowflake. Here are the main approaches:\\n\\n**Method 1: Clone first, then add clustering keys**\\n1. Create a clone of the existing table:\\n   ```sql\\n   CREATE TABLE new_table CLONE existing_table;\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Add clustering keys to the cloned table:\\n   ```sql\\n   ALTER TABLE new_table CLUSTER BY (column1, column2);\\n   ```\\n\\n**Method 2: Create clone with clustering keys in one step**\\nYou can also create a new table with clustering keys using CREATE TABLE AS SELECT:\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE new_table \\nCLUSTER BY (column1, column2) \\nAS SELECT * FROM existing_table;\\n```\\n\\n**Key considerations:**\\n- Cloning preserves the data and structure but not necessarily the clustering keys from the original table\\n- You can add clustering keys to any table after creation using ALTER TABLE\\n- Clustering keys help optimize query performance by physically organizing data\\n- You can specify up to 4 columns as clustering keys\\n- The clustering process happens automatically in the background after you define the keys\\n\\n**Benefits of adding clustering keys:**\\n- Improved query performance for filtered queries\\n- Better data pruning during query execution\\n- Reduced scan times for large tables\\n\\nThe clone operation is very fast since it uses Snowflake's zero-copy cloning feature, and adding clustering keys afterward will help optimize the table for your specific query patterns.\\n</answer>\",\"User: is if i have a transactiondate as type string sohuld i make it a date?\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about whether they should convert a transaction date column from string type to date type. This is a data modeling and database design question about data types in Snowflake. This doesn't require querying any of the available semantic models or searching documents - it's a best practices question about data types.\\n\\nI should provide guidance on the benefits of using proper date data types versus string types for date information.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nYes, you should definitely convert a transaction date from string to date type. Here's why:\\n\\n**Benefits of using DATE data type:**\\n\\n**Performance advantages:**\\n- Date operations are much faster than string operations\\n- Better query optimization and indexing\\n- More efficient storage (dates take less space than strings)\\n- Improved clustering and partitioning performance\\n\\n**Functionality benefits:**\\n- Built-in date functions (DATE_TRUNC, DATEADD, DATEDIFF, etc.)\\n- Proper date arithmetic and comparisons\\n- Time zone handling capabilities\\n- Automatic validation of date values\\n\\n**Query improvements:**\\n- Range queries perform better (WHERE date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31')\\n- Date formatting functions work properly\\n- Aggregations by time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly) are easier\\n\\n**How to convert:**\\n```sql\\n-- Add new date column\\nALTER TABLE your_table ADD COLUMN transaction_date_new DATE;\\n\\n-- Convert string to date\\nUPDATE your_table \\nSET transaction_date_new = TRY_TO_DATE(transaction_date_string, 'YYYY-MM-DD');\\n\\n-- Check for conversion errors\\nSELECT * FROM your_table WHERE transaction_date_new IS NULL;\\n\\n-- Drop old column and rename new one\\nALTER TABLE your_table DROP COLUMN transaction_date_string;\\nALTER TABLE your_table RENAME COLUMN transaction_date_new TO transaction_date;\\n```\\n\\n**Important considerations:**\\n- Use TRY_TO_DATE() to handle invalid date strings gracefully\\n- Verify the date format in your string data first\\n- Check for any NULL values after conversion\\n- Consider if you need DATE, TIMESTAMP, or TIMESTAMP_TZ based on your requirements\\n\\nConverting to proper date types is almost always worth the effort for better performance and functionality.\\n</answer>\",\"User: does clustering take time? i just ran a cluster by and i am seeing very high overlap\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about clustering performance and mentions they're seeing \\\"very high overlap\\\" after running a CLUSTER BY command. This is a question about Snowflake's clustering feature, specifically about:\\n\\n1. Whether clustering takes time to complete\\n2. What \\\"high overlap\\\" means in the context of clustering\\n3. Likely asking for guidance on what to expect and how to interpret clustering metrics\\n\\nThis is a technical question about Snowflake functionality, not requiring data queries from the semantic models or document searches.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nYes, clustering does take time, and seeing high overlap immediately after adding clustering keys is completely normal. Here's what's happening:\\n\\n**Why clustering takes time:**\\n- Clustering is an **asynchronous background process** that Snowflake runs automatically\\n- It doesn't happen instantly when you run `ALTER TABLE ... CLUSTER BY`\\n- The process reorganizes data physically based on your clustering keys\\n- Time depends on table size, data distribution, and system resources\\n\\n**What \\\"high overlap\\\" means:**\\n- Overlap measures how much data in different micro-partitions shares the same clustering key values\\n- **High overlap = poor clustering** (data is scattered across many micro-partitions)\\n- **Low overlap = good clustering** (similar values are grouped together)\\n- Right after adding clustering keys, overlap will be high because data hasn't been reorganized yet\\n\\n**What to expect:**\\n```sql\\n-- Check clustering information\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('your_table', '(column1, column2)');\\n\\n-- Monitor clustering depth and overlap over time\\nSHOW TABLES LIKE 'your_table';\\n-- Look at CLUSTERING_KEY and other clustering metrics\\n```\\n\\n**Timeline expectations:**\\n- Small tables (< 1GB): Minutes to hours\\n- Medium tables (1-100GB): Hours to days  \\n- Large tables (> 100GB): Days to weeks\\n- Process runs during low-activity periods to minimize impact\\n\\n**Best practices:**\\n- Be patient - let the automatic clustering process work\\n- Monitor progress with `SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION()`\\n- Don't re-cluster manually unless absolutely necessary\\n- Choose clustering keys wisely (commonly filtered columns)\\n\\nThe high overlap you're seeing should decrease over time as Snowflake's automatic clustering service reorganizes your data in the background.\\n</answer>\",\"User: Quesiton for you. This table is massive 1TB. TRANSACTION_DATE has cardinatlit of 2700 unique vlaues. ACCOUNT_ID has very high cardinality of 7.4 million unique values. Does it make sense to add a clustering key on both columns or only one?\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about clustering strategy for a very large table (1TB) with two potential clustering key columns:\\n- TRANSACTION_DATE: Low cardinality (2,700 unique values)\\n- ACCOUNT_ID: Very high cardinality (7.4 million unique values)\\n\\nThis is a question about Snowflake clustering best practices and strategy. I need to consider:\\n1. The size of the table (1TB is very large)\\n2. The cardinality differences between the columns\\n3. How clustering works with different cardinality levels\\n4. Query patterns that would benefit from clustering\\n5. Snowflake's recommendations for clustering key selection\\n\\nThis doesn't require querying data or searching documents - it's about database optimization strategy.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nFor a 1TB table with those cardinality characteristics, I'd recommend **clustering on TRANSACTION_DATE only**, not both columns. Here's why:\\n\\n**Why TRANSACTION_DATE alone is better:**\\n\\n**Cardinality considerations:**\\n- 2,700 unique dates is ideal for clustering (good selectivity without being too granular)\\n- 7.4M unique ACCOUNT_IDs is extremely high cardinality - poor for clustering\\n- High cardinality clustering keys often provide minimal benefit and can hurt performance\\n\\n**Query pattern benefits:**\\n- Most analytical queries filter by date ranges (monthly/quarterly reports, time-based analysis)\\n- Date-based clustering enables excellent partition pruning\\n- Time-series data naturally benefits from chronological organization\\n\\n**Why not both columns:**\\n- **Compound clustering keys become less effective** with high cardinality columns\\n- ACCOUNT_ID's 7.4M values would create too much fragmentation\\n- The clustering maintenance overhead increases significantly\\n- Diminishing returns on query performance improvement\\n\\n**Recommended approach:**\\n```sql\\nALTER TABLE your_table CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTION_DATE);\\n```\\n\\n**Alternative considerations:**\\n- If you frequently query specific account ranges, consider **partitioning strategies** instead\\n- For account-specific queries, proper indexing or materialized views might be better\\n- Consider if ACCOUNT_ID has any patterns (geographic, categorical) that could be clustered instead\\n\\n**Expected benefits with date clustering:**\\n- Dramatic improvement for date range queries\\n- Better compression due to similar dates being stored together\\n- Faster aggregations by time periods\\n- Reduced scanning for time-based analytics\\n\\nThe 1TB size makes clustering even more valuable, but stick with the low-cardinality date column for maximum effectiveness.\\n</answer>\",\"User: my clustering depth on my table is 96\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is reporting that their clustering depth is 96. This is a very high clustering depth number, and I need to explain what this means and provide guidance.\\n\\nClustering depth in Snowflake indicates how many micro-partitions need to be scanned on average to find all values for a clustering key. A depth of 96 is quite high and suggests poor clustering.\\n\\nThis is about Snowflake clustering metrics and optimization, so I should explain what this means and provide actionable advice.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nA clustering depth of 96 is **very high** and indicates poor clustering. Here's what this means and what you should do:\\n\\n**What clustering depth means:**\\n- Clustering depth = average number of micro-partitions that must be scanned to find all rows for a clustering key value\\n- **Ideal range: 1-10** (excellent clustering)\\n- **Acceptable range: 10-50** (decent clustering)\\n- **Your depth of 96 = poor clustering** (data is very scattered)\\n\\n**Why your depth is so high:**\\n- Data is spread across many micro-partitions instead of being grouped together\\n- For your 1TB table, this means inefficient scanning\\n- Could be due to:\\n  - Recent large data loads without clustering maintenance\\n  - Poor clustering key choice (though TRANSACTION_DATE should be good)\\n  - Data insertion patterns that scatter dates across partitions\\n\\n**Immediate actions:**\\n\\n**1. Check current clustering status:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('your_table', '(TRANSACTION_DATE)');\\n```\\n\\n**2. Consider manual re-clustering (carefully):**\\n```sql\\n-- Only if absolutely necessary and during low-usage periods\\nALTER TABLE your_table RECLUSTER;\\n```\\n\\n**3. Monitor the automatic clustering:**\\n- Snowflake's automatic clustering should gradually improve this\\n- With 1TB, it may take days/weeks to fully optimize\\n- Check progress daily with the clustering information function\\n\\n**Expected improvements:**\\n- Target depth should eventually reach 10-30 for your table size\\n- Query performance will improve significantly as depth decreases\\n- Partition pruning will become much more effective\\n\\n**Warning:** Manual reclustering on a 1TB table will be expensive and time-consuming. Let automatic clustering work first, and only manually recluster if it's not improving after a reasonable time period.</answer>\",\"User: which function should i use to check? i see there's two\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about which function to use to check clustering information, and they mention there are two functions. In Snowflake, there are indeed two main functions for checking clustering information:\\n\\n1. SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION() - provides detailed clustering metrics\\n2. SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH() - provides just the clustering depth\\n\\nI should explain both functions and recommend which one to use for their situation.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nYou're right, there are two main functions. Here's when to use each:\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION() - Use this one for comprehensive analysis:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('your_table', '(TRANSACTION_DATE)');\\n```\\n\\n**Returns detailed JSON with:**\\n- Clustering depth\\n- Overlap percentage  \\n- Total micro-partitions\\n- Clustered micro-partitions\\n- Average depth\\n- Notes and recommendations\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH() - Use for quick depth check:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('your_table', '(TRANSACTION_DATE)');\\n```\\n\\n**Returns only:**\\n- Simple clustering depth number (like your 96)\\n\\n**My recommendation: Use SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION()**\\n\\nFor your situation with the high clustering depth of 96, you want the full picture. The comprehensive function will show you:\\n- Current overlap percentage (you mentioned it was high)\\n- How many partitions are actually clustered\\n- Progress over time as automatic clustering works\\n- Specific recommendations from Snowflake\\n\\n**Example of what you'll see:**\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"cluster_by_keys\\\": \\\"(TRANSACTION_DATE)\\\",\\n  \\\"total_partition_count\\\": 15000,\\n  \\\"total_constant_partition_count\\\": 1200,\\n  \\\"average_overlaps\\\": 85.2,\\n  \\\"average_depth\\\": 96.0,\\n  \\\"partition_depth_histogram\\\": {...}\\n}\\n```\\n\\nUse the comprehensive function to monitor your clustering progress as the automatic process works to reduce that depth from 96 to a more reasonable number.\\n</answer>\",\"User: What's the differnce between these?\\n\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED', '(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)');\\n\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED');\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about the difference between two specific clustering functions they're running on their PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED table. I notice a few important differences in their examples:\\n\\n1. SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION() - they're specifying specific clustering keys (PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)\\n2. SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH() - they're not specifying any clustering keys\\n\\nThis is important because earlier they mentioned they were considering clustering on TRANSACTION_DATE only due to the high cardinality of ACCOUNT_ID, but now I see they're checking clustering information for both columns together.\\n\\nI should explain the differences between these functions and also point out the implications of their clustering key choices.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nHere are the key differences between those two functions:\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED', '(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)'):**\\n- **Detailed analysis** of clustering for the specific keys you specify\\n- Returns comprehensive JSON with metrics like overlap, depth, partition counts\\n- **Analyzes the compound clustering key** (both PLAIDACCOUNTID and TRANSACTIONDATE together)\\n- Shows how well data is clustered based on those specific columns\\n\\n**SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_DEPTH('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED'):**\\n- **Simple numeric result** - just the clustering depth\\n- **Uses the table's actual defined clustering keys** (whatever was set with ALTER TABLE CLUSTER BY)\\n- No column specification needed - reads from table metadata\\n- Quick check of current clustering effectiveness\\n\\n**Important observation:**\\nI notice you're checking clustering info for **(PLAIDACCOUNTID, TRANSACTIONDATE)** together, but earlier you were considering clustering on TRANSACTIONDATE only due to PLAIDACCOUNTID's high cardinality (7.4M values).\\n\\n**Questions to consider:**\\n- Did you end up clustering on both columns?\\n- If so, that compound key might be why your clustering depth is 96\\n- The high cardinality PLAIDACCOUNTID could be fragmenting your clustering\\n\\n**To check what clustering keys are actually defined:**\\n```sql\\nSHOW TABLES LIKE 'PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED';\\n-- Look at the CLUSTERING_KEY column\\n```\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\nCompare the clustering information for just TRANSACTIONDATE vs. the compound key to see which performs better:\\n```sql\\nSELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED', '(TRANSACTIONDATE)');\\n```</answer>\",\"User: Yes im clustered on by in order (date, id) my depth now has gone down to 18\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is providing an update on their clustering situation. They've confirmed they are clustering on both columns in the order (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID), and their clustering depth has improved significantly from 96 down to 18. This is actually a good result and shows that the automatic clustering process is working.\\n\\nI should acknowledge this improvement and provide context on what this means for their performance, while also noting that the compound clustering key is actually working better than I initially expected given the high cardinality of the ID column.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nThat's excellent progress! Your clustering depth dropping from 96 to 18 is a **significant improvement** and shows the automatic clustering is working well.\\n\\n**What this means:**\\n- **Depth of 18 is good** for a 1TB table with compound clustering keys\\n- You're now in the \\\"acceptable to good\\\" range (10-50)\\n- Query performance should be noticeably better\\n- Partition pruning is much more effective\\n\\n**Why the compound key (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID) is working:**\\n- **Date as the first key** provides the primary organization (smart choice)\\n- **ID as secondary** helps with account-specific queries without fragmenting too much\\n- The order matters - date first gives you the time-based benefits\\n\\n**Expected benefits you should see:**\\n- Date range queries: Much faster scanning\\n- Account-specific queries: Better partition pruning\\n- Combined date + account filters: Excellent performance\\n- Overall query costs: Reduced due to less data scanning\\n\\n**Monitoring going forward:**\\n- Depth might continue to improve slightly (target: 10-15 for optimal)\\n- Check overlap percentage - should also be decreasing\\n- Monitor query performance improvements\\n\\n**Bottom line:** Your clustering strategy is working well! The combination of low-cardinality date first, followed by high-cardinality ID, is proving effective for your data distribution. The automatic clustering process should continue to optimize this further, but you're already seeing the major benefits.\\n\\nGreat job on the clustering key selection and patience with the process!\\n</answer>\",\"User: does clustering change the size of Micropartiioons or just the order?\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about what clustering actually does to micro-partitions - whether it changes their size or just reorders them. This is a good technical question about how Snowflake's clustering mechanism works at the storage level.\\n\\nI need to explain:\\n1. What clustering does to micro-partitions\\n2. Whether it changes size vs. just reorganizing\\n3. How the physical storage is affected\\n4. The relationship between clustering and micro-partition structure\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nClustering **reorganizes and can change the composition** of micro-partitions, not just their order. Here's what actually happens:\\n\\n**What clustering does:**\\n\\n**1. Reorganizes data physically:**\\n- Moves rows with similar clustering key values into the same micro-partitions\\n- Can **split and merge micro-partitions** to achieve better clustering\\n- Creates new micro-partitions with better data locality\\n\\n**2. Micro-partition size effects:**\\n- **Size range stays the same** (50-500MB compressed, typically ~16MB)\\n- **Contents change** - similar clustering key values get grouped together\\n- May create new micro-partitions and mark old ones for deletion\\n\\n**3. Physical changes:**\\n- **Not just reordering** - actual data reorganization\\n- Rows get physically moved between micro-partitions\\n- Better compression often results from grouping similar data\\n\\n**Example of what happens:**\\n```\\nBefore clustering:\\nPartition 1: Dates [2023-01-01, 2023-06-15, 2023-12-31] + various accounts\\nPartition 2: Dates [2023-01-03, 2023-07-20, 2023-11-15] + various accounts\\n\\nAfter clustering:\\nPartition 1: Dates [2023-01-01, 2023-01-02, 2023-01-03] + related accounts  \\nPartition 2: Dates [2023-06-15, 2023-06-20, 2023-06-25] + related accounts\\n```\\n\\n**Storage implications:**\\n- **Storage usage may temporarily increase** during clustering (old + new partitions)\\n- **Better compression** often results from grouping similar values\\n- **Metadata updates** to track new partition boundaries\\n\\n**Performance benefits come from:**\\n- **Partition pruning** - skip irrelevant micro-partitions entirely\\n- **Better compression** - similar data compresses better\\n- **Reduced I/O** - related data stored together\\n\\nSo clustering is much more than reordering - it's a complete physical reorganization of how your data is stored in micro-partitions.\\n</answer>\",\"User: how can i set use chaced result to false\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking how to disable cached results in Snowflake. This is about the USE_CACHED_RESULT parameter/setting in Snowflake, which controls whether queries can use previously cached query results.\\n\\nThis is a straightforward technical question about Snowflake session parameters.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nYou can disable cached results in several ways depending on your scope:\\n\\n**1. For your current session:**\\n```sql\\nALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n```\\n\\n**2. For a specific query:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT /*+ NO_CACHE */ * FROM your_table;\\n-- OR use the parameter in the query\\nSELECT * FROM your_table;\\n-- Run with USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE set for session\\n```\\n\\n**3.

Snowflake doesn't allow parameter setting within the SELECT statement itself.\\n\\n**Most practical approach:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n-- Your query here\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';\\n```</answer>\",\"User: will this work in a worksheet?\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking if the SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE syntax will work in a Snowflake worksheet. This is a good question because worksheets in Snowflake's web interface handle multi-statement execution differently than some other SQL tools.\\n\\nI should clarify how this works in Snowflake worksheets specifically, including any considerations about statement execution and session scope.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nYes, it will work in a Snowflake worksheet! Here's how:\\n\\n**In a Snowflake worksheet, you can run:**\\n\\n**Option 1: Select and run both statements together:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15';\\n```\\n- Highlight both lines and click \\\"Run\\\"\\n- Or put cursor anywhere and run all statements\\n\\n**Option 2: Run statements separately:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n```\\nRun this first, then run:\\n```sql\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15';\\n```\\n\\n**Important worksheet behavior:**\\n- The `SET` command affects your **entire worksheet session**\\n- Once set to FALSE, all subsequent queries in that worksheet won't use cache\\n- Persists until you close the worksheet or set it back to TRUE\\n- Each worksheet has its own session scope\\n\\n**To reset caching in the same worksheet:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;\\n```\\n\\n**Pro tip for testing:**\\n```sql\\n-- Disable caching\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;\\n\\n-- Test your clustering performance\\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31';\\n\\n-- Re-enable caching when done\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE;\\n```\\n\\nThis is perfect for testing your clustering improvements without cached results interfering!\\n</answer>\",\"User: is search optimization and clustering complementary or should i only use one or the other?\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about the relationship between Snowflake's Search Optimization Service and clustering - whether they work together (complementary) or if they should only use one approach. This is a good question about Snowflake optimization strategies.\\n\\nI need to explain:\\n1. What each feature does\\n2. How they work together\\n3. When to use one vs both\\n4. Any potential conflicts or considerations\\n5. Best practices for their specific use case (1TB table with date and account ID)\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nSearch Optimization and clustering are **complementary** - you can and often should use both together! They optimize for different query patterns.\\n\\n**How they work together:**\\n\\n**Clustering optimizes for:**\\n- Range queries (date ranges, numeric ranges)\\n- Equality filters on clustered columns\\n- Time-series analysis\\n- Partition pruning at the micro-partition level\\n\\n**Search Optimization optimizes for:**\\n- Point lookups (exact value searches)\\n- Substring searches\\n- High-cardinality equality filters\\n- Queries that don't benefit much from clustering\\n\\n**For your PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED table:**\\n\\n**Use clustering for:**\\n```sql\\n-- These benefit from your (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID) clustering\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-03-31';\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTIONDATE = '2023-06-15' AND PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'account123';\\n```\\n\\n**Add search optimization for:**\\n```sql\\n-- Enable search optimization\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;\\n\\n-- These would benefit from search optimization\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE DESCRIPTION ILIKE '%coffee%';\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE MERCHANT_NAME = 'Starbucks';\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE TRANSACTION_ID = 'specific_id';\\n```\\n\\n**Best practice - use both:**\\n```sql\\n-- Your existing clustering (keep this)\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n\\n-- Add search optimization\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION;\\n```\\n\\n**Cost considerations:**\\n- Clustering: Automatic maintenance cost\\n- Search optimization: Additional storage cost (~20-100% increase)\\n- Both provide query performance benefits that often offset costs\\n\\n**Bottom line:** Keep your clustering for date/account queries, and add search optimization for text searches and point lookups on other columns. They work together beautifully!\\n</answer>\",\"User: does it make sense to add search optimization on top of the clustering columns?\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThis is a great question about whether to add search optimization on columns that are already clustered. The user is asking specifically about adding search optimization to TRANSACTIONDATE and PLAIDACCOUNTID, which are already their clustering keys.\\n\\nI need to consider:\\n1. Whether search optimization provides additional benefits on clustered columns\\n2. The cost/benefit analysis\\n3. What types of queries would benefit\\n4. Snowflake's recommendations on this\\n5. The specific characteristics of their columns (date with 2,700 values, account ID with 7.4M values)\\n</thinking> <answer>\\n**Generally no** - adding search optimization on top of clustering columns usually doesn't make sense. Here's why:\\n\\n**For your clustering columns:**\\n\\n**TRANSACTIONDATE (2,700 unique values):**\\n- **Clustering already handles this well** for range queries and equality\\n- Search optimization would provide minimal additional benefit\\n- **Not worth the cost** - clustering gives you excellent partition pruning\\n\\n**PLAIDACCOUNTID (7.4M unique values):**\\n- **This might be an exception** - high cardinality can benefit from search optimization\\n- Clustering helps when combined with date, but search optimization could help for account-only queries\\n- **Consider it** if you frequently query by account ID alone\\n\\n**Better approach - optimize non-clustered columns:**\\n```sql\\n-- Keep your existing clustering\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED CLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n\\n-- Add search optimization for OTHER columns that aren't clustered\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION \\nON (DESCRIPTION, MERCHANT_NAME, CATEGORY, TRANSACTION_ID);\\n```\\n\\n**Cost/benefit analysis:**\\n- **Clustering columns**: Already optimized, search optimization = redundant cost\\n- **Non-clustered columns**: No optimization, search optimization = high value\\n\\n**Exception case:**\\nIf you frequently run queries like:\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'specific_account';  -- No date filter\\n```\\n\\nThen search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID might help, but test the performance improvement vs. cost.\\n\\n**Recommendation:** Skip search optimization on TRANSACTIONDATE, maybe consider it for PLAIDACCOUNTID if you have account-only queries, but definitely add it to other frequently-queried columns that aren't clustered.\\n</answer>\",\"User: What does Percentage scanned from cache mean? I received a high number but i thought i turned off the cahce with that parameter\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nThe user is asking about \\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" and they're confused because they thought they turned off caching with the USE_CACHED_RESULT parameter. This is a good question because there are different types of caching in Snowflake, and the USE_CACHED_RESULT parameter only affects one type.\\n\\nI need to explain:\\n1. The different types of caching in Snowflake\\n2. What \\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" specifically refers to\\n3. Why they're still seeing cache usage despite setting USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE\\n4. The difference between result caching and data caching\\n</thinking> <answer>\\n\\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" refers to **data cache** (warehouse cache), not **result cache** - these are different types of caching in Snowflake!\\n\\n**Two different cache types:**\\n\\n**1. Result Cache (what you disabled):**\\n- `USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE` disables this\\n- Stores complete query results for 24 hours\\n- Avoids re-running identical queries entirely\\n\\n**2. Data Cache/Warehouse Cache (still active):**\\n- **Cannot be disabled** - this is what \\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" measures\\n- Stores raw data in SSD cache on warehouse nodes\\n- Speeds up data retrieval from storage\\n- **This is good!** - you want high cache hit rates here\\n\\n**What you're seeing:**\\n```\\nPercentage scanned from cache: 85% (example)\\n```\\nThis means:\\n- 85% of data was read from fast SSD cache on warehouse\\n- 15% had to be fetched from slower remote storage\\n- **This is excellent performance** - high cache hit rate\\n\\n**Why this happens even with USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE:**\\n- Your query still runs (no result cache used)\\n- But data needed for the query comes from warehouse cache\\n- Especially common if you're running similar queries or accessing same date ranges\\n\\n**What you disabled vs. what's still working:**\\n- ❌ **Result cache**: Query won't reuse previous identical results\\n- ✅ **Data cache**: Data blocks still cached in warehouse for faster access\\n\\n**Bottom line:** High \\\"Percentage scanned from cache\\\" is **good news** - it means your warehouse is efficiently caching frequently accessed data, making your clustering performance tests faster and more realistic for typical usage patterns.\\n</answer>\",\"User: So should I add search optimization or not on PLAIDACCOUNTID? It has 6.7 unique values. Right now cluster depth is 7 for CLUSTER BY (DATE, ID).

They've provided some key information:\\n\\n1. PLAIDACCOUNTID has 6.7 unique values (I think they mean 6.7 million, based on earlier conversation where they mentioned 7.4 million)\\n2. Current clustering depth is 7 (which is excellent!)\\n3. Their query pattern is very specific: SELECT * WHERE ACCOUNTID = X AND TRANSACTION_DATE is last 100 days\\n\\nThis is actually a perfect use case for their current clustering strategy. The query pattern they described should work very well with their existing clustering on (DATE, ID) because:\\n- They're filtering on both clustered columns\\n- Date range + specific account ID is exactly what compound clustering optimizes for\\n- Clustering depth of 7 is excellent\\n\\nGiven this specific query pattern, search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID would likely be redundant and not cost-effective.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\n**No, don't add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID** for your use case. Here's why:\\n\\n**Your query pattern is perfect for clustering:**\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM table \\nWHERE PLAIDACCOUNTID = 'XXXXXXX' \\n  AND TRANSACTIONDATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 100;\\n```\\n\\n**Why clustering already handles this optimally:**\\n- **Clustering depth of 7 is excellent** (ideal range is 1-10)\\n- Your compound clustering `(TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID)` is **perfectly designed** for this query pattern\\n- Date range (last 100 days) + specific account ID = **maximum clustering benefit**\\n- Snowflake will prune partitions based on both date range AND account ID\\n\\n**Search optimization would be redundant because:**\\n- You're **always filtering by both clustered columns**\\n- Clustering already provides excellent partition pruning\\n- Search optimization cost wouldn't be justified\\n- Your depth of 7 shows clustering is working perfectly\\n\\n**Cost/benefit analysis:**\\n- **Current clustering**: Handles your queries optimally (depth = 7)\\n- **Adding search optimization**: Extra storage cost (~20-100%) for minimal/no benefit\\n\\n**Recommendation:**\\n```sql\\n-- Keep your existing clustering (it's working great!)\\n-- DON'T add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID\\n\\n-- Only consider search optimization for other columns if you query them:\\n-- ALTER TABLE ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (DESCRIPTION, MERCHANT_NAME);\\n```\\n\\n**Your clustering strategy is spot-on** for your query patterns.

Given their query pattern (SELECT * WHERE ACCOUNTID = X AND TRANSACTIONDATE in last 100 days) and their current clustering setup with depth 7, I need to think about what additional optimizations could help achieve the lowest possible latency.\\n\\nFor low latency, they should consider:\\n1. Their current clustering is already very good (depth 7)\\n2. Search optimization might actually help for the PLAIDACCOUNTID lookups even though it's clustered\\n3. Other optimizations like warehouse size, result caching (when appropriate), materialized views\\n4. The specific nature of their query pattern\\n\\nGiven that they need LOW LATENCY specifically, the cost/benefit calculation changes. Even small improvements might be worth it.\\n</thinking> <answer>\\nFor **low latency**, the calculation changes - you should **consider adding search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID**. Here's why:\\n\\n**Low latency optimization strategy:**\\n\\n**1. Keep your excellent clustering (depth 7 is great):**\\n```sql\\n-- Your current setup is already optimized\\nCLUSTER BY (TRANSACTIONDATE, PLAIDACCOUNTID)\\n```\\n\\n**2. Add search optimization for the account lookup:**\\n```sql\\nALTER TABLE PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (PLAIDACCOUNTID);\\n```\\n\\n**Why this helps for low latency:**\\n- **Point lookup optimization**: Even with clustering, search optimization can make the account ID lookup faster\\n- **Micro-second improvements**: For low latency, every optimization counts\\n- **High cardinality benefit**: 6.7M unique values can benefit from search optimization's indexing\\n- **Compound benefit**: Clustering + search optimization working together\\n\\n**Additional low latency optimizations:**\\n\\n**3. Warehouse sizing:**\\n```sql\\n-- Use larger warehouse for lower latency\\nALTER WAREHOUSE your_warehouse SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE'; -- or XL\\n```\\n\\n**4. Consider materialized views for common patterns:**\\n```sql\\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW recent_transactions AS\\nSELECT * FROM PLAIDTRANSACTION_PARSED \\nWHERE TRANSACTIONDATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 100;\\n```\\n\\n**5. Enable result caching for repeated queries:**\\n```sql\\nSET USE_CACHED_RESULT = TRUE; -- For production queries\\n```\\n\\n**Cost vs. latency trade-off:**\\n- Search optimization cost: ~20-100% storage increase\\n- Latency improvement: Potentially 10-50% faster account lookups\\n- **For low latency requirements**: Usually worth it\\n\\n**Bottom line:** Your clustering is excellent, but for true low latency, add search optimization on PLAIDACCOUNTID. The combination of both optimizations will give you the fastest possible performance for your query pattern.\\n</answer>\",\"User: I want to create a copy of my table and then add search optimization to compare the differences.

This is an important question because they want to ensure they're doing a fair comparison - testing only the difference that search optimization makes, not clustering differences.\\n\\nIn Snowflake, when you clone a table, it preserves:\\n1. The table structure (columns, data types)\\n2. The data itself (zero-copy clone)\\n3. The clustering keys definition\\n4.

Use the following provided verified queries to interpret the user question and generated SQL:  - Question: which current employee has the longest reporting chain?\\n\\n   SQL: SELECT employee_name, org_level FROM reporting_chain_flat WHERE is_active = TRUE ORDER BY org_level DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1\\n - Question: what are the names, titles, emails, and org level of everyone reporting into Jeff Hollan?\\n\\n   SQL: SELECT wdu.employee_name, wdu.business_title, wdu.primary_work_email, rcf.org_level FROM snowflake_intelligence.workday.reporting_chain_flat rcf join snowflake_intelligence.workday.sfdc_workday_user_with_reporting_chain wdu on rcf.employee_id = wdu.employee_id where org_level_up_name = 'Jeff Hollan' and rcf.is_active = TRUE;\\n\",\"Cortex Search is a search tool that allows you to query a document index for relevant documents. The tool is backed by 1 or more search indices. If more than index is present, your query will be issued to all of them and their results will be merged. The following are descriptions of the search indices available to this tool:\\nSearch Index Confluence:\\nDescription: \\n\\nSearch Index Snowflake_Documentation:\\nDescription: \\n\\n\"]\n",
