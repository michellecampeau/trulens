    "    1: The search result has low relevance to the user query. In this case the search result may contain some information which seems very slightly related to the user query but not enough information to answer the user query. The search result contains some references or very limited information about some entities present in the user query. In case the query is a statement on a topic, the search result should be tangentially related to it.\n",
    "    2: The search result has medium relevance to the user query. If the user query is a question, the search result may contain some information that is relevant to the user query but not enough information to answer the user query. If the user query is a search phrase/sentence, either the search result is centered around about most but not all entities present in the user query, or if all the entities are present in the result, the search result while not being centered around it has medium level of relevance.

Otherwise if the search query is a search phrase/sentence, it provides relevant information about all entities that are present in the user query and the search result is centered around the entities mentioned in the query.

    "    Example 1:\n",
    "    INPUT:\n",
    "    User Query: What is the definition of an accordion?\n",
    "    Search Result: Accordion definition, Also called piano accordion. a portable wind instrument having a large bellows for forcing air through small metal reeds, a keyboard for the right hand, and buttons for sounding single bass notes or chords for the left hand. a similar instrument having single-note buttons instead of a keyboard.\n",
    "    OUTPUT:\n",
    "    Rating: 3\n",
    "    Reasoning: In this case the search query is a question. The search result directly answers the user question for the definition of an accordion, hence it has high relevance to the user query.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 2:\n",
    "    INPUT:\n",
    "    User Query: dark horse\n",
    "    Search Result: Darkhorse is a person who everyone expects to be last in a race. Think of it this way. The person who looks like he can never get laid defies the odds and gets any girl he can by being sly,shy and cunning. Although he\\'s not a player, he can really charm the ladies.\n",
    "    OUTPUT:\n",
    "    Rating: 3\n",
    "    Reasoning: In this case the search query is a search phrase mentioning \\'dark horse\\'. The search result contains information about the term \\'dark horse\\' and provides a definition for it and is centered around it. Hence it has high relevance to the user query.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 3:\n",
    "    INPUT:\n",
    "    User Query: Global warming and polar bears\n",
    "    Search Result: Polar bear The polar bear is a carnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi).\n",
    "    OUTPUT:\n",
    "    Rating: 2\n",
    "    Reasoning: In this case the search query is a search phrase mentioning two entities \\'Global warming\\' and \\'polar bears\\'. The search result contains is centered around the polar bear which is one of the two entities in the search query. Therefore it addresses most of the entities present and hence has medium relevance. \n",

    "    OUTPUT:\n",
    "    Rating: 1\n",
    "    Reasoning: In this case the search result is a search query mentioning \\'Snowflake synapse private link\\'. However the search result doesn\\'t contain information about it. However it shows an error message for a generic private link which is tangentially related to the query, since snowflake synapse private link is a type of private link. Hence it has low relevance to the user query.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 5:\n",
    "    INPUT:\n",
    "    User Query: The Punisher is American.\n",
    "    Search Result: The Rev(Samuel Smith) is a fictional character, a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Mike Baron and Klaus Janson, the character made his first appearance in The Punisher Vol. 2, #4 (November 1987). He is an enemy of the Punisher.\n",
    "    OUTPUT:\n",
    "    Rating: 1\n",
    "    Reasoning: In this case the search query is a statement concerning the Punisher. However the search result is about a character called Rev, who is an enemy of the Punisher. The search result is tangentially related to the user query but does not address topic about Punisher being an American. Hence it has low relevance to the user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 6:\n",
    "    INPUT:\n",
    "    User Query: query_history\n",
    "    Search Result: The function task_history() is not enough for the purposes when the required result set is more than 10k.If we perform UNION between information_schema and account_usage , then we will get more than 10k records along with recent records as from information_schema.query_history to snowflake.account_usage.query_history is 45 mins behind.\n",
    "    OUTPUT:\n",
    "    Rating: 1\n",
    "    Reasoning: In this case the search query mentioning one entity \\'query_history\\'. The search result is neither centered around it and neither has medium relevance, it only contains an unimportant reference to it. Hence it has low relevance to the user query.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 7:\n",
    "    INPUT:\n",
    "    User Query: Who directed pulp fiction?\n",
    "    Search Result: Life on Earth first appeared as early as 4.28 billion years ago, soon after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago.\n",
    "    OUTPUT:\n",
    "    Rating: 0\n",
    "    Reasoning: In the case the search query is a question. However the search result does is completely unrelated to it. Hence the search result is completely irrelevant to the movie pulp fiction. \n",
