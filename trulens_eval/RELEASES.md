# Releases

Releases are organized in `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` style. A release is made
about every week around tuesday-thursday. Releases increment the `minor` version
number. Occasionally bug-fix releases occur after a weekly release. Those
increment only the `patch` number. No releases have yet made a `major` version
increment. Those are expected to be major releases that introduce large number
of breaking changes.
